# Storybook staging environment

[Chromatic link](https://645a5781c0021a5d05d60c23-lgrriagthp.chromatic.com/)

# Motivation

We currently have the [/components](https://commonwealth.im/components) page to showcase all commonwealth components. This page is a static and general listing and you can't do a lot with them.

Storybook allows us to display simple or complex components, see their behaviour or how they will look like realtime when you change the button color to black, the text to "Vote", apply certain icon to the right, etc.

It's a great place to collaborate on UI develoment with designers, product managers, developers or other stakeholders.
