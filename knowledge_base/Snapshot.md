# Snapshot

## Setting up Snapshot Spaces

### Requirements

- The Ethereum wallet you use must have an ENS (Ethereum Name Service) domain ([see how to create one](https://github.com/hicommonwealth/commonwealth/wiki/Setup-ENS))
- Snapshots only work with Ethereum communities, you must be an admin of an Ethereum-based community to work with the new snapshot space

### Setup

1. Change your wallet address to Eth Mainnet
2. Go to <https://snapshot.org/#/setup?step=0> and connect your wallet from the "Connect wallet" button, and click on Get started

3. Enter your ENS domain and click 'register'

Choose "Whitelist voting" and add your wallet address (or any other address you want to whitelist)

Click "next" and add members address (you can also add your own), and click continue

Important: If you want someone else to use your snapshot space, then add their address as an author here. Now your space is created.

5. Go to your community on commonwealth (you must be admin), go to manage community setting, and in the "Snapshot/s" field add your ens.

Now you should be able to create snapshot proposals with this test space.
