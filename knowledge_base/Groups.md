## Introduction to Groups

`Groups` are used by community admins to handle permissioning across the forum, using associated `Membership` objects that link `Addresses` to Groups.

Forum actions are always topic-scoped; whenever a user creates a new thread, reacts to a comment, or participates in a poll, they are operating within the scope of a topic. Groups allow admins to "gate" these user actions, within a given topic-scope, based on a set of Requirements.

Groups are defined by sets of `Requirements`. A Requirement is a rule or logical statement that qualifies a given address for Group membership. As of 231031, the two Requirements supported on our backend are token thresholds (i.e., that a given address has a certain token balance) and allowlists (i.e., whitelists manually constructed by a community admin).

From a database perspective, Groups consist of a metadata object, an associated Community (chain), an associated Membership, and an array of Requirements. Requirement objects consist of a `rule` string (e.g. "threshold") and a data object (e.g. `ThresholdData`). Requirement objects must conform to the latest JSON schema; as of 231109, that is [v1](../packages/commonwealth/server/util/requirementsModule/requirementsSchema_v1.ts). Membership validation checks, and requirement types can be found in the `/server/util/requirementsModule` directory.

## API Diagrams

### Membership Check

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

  rect rgb(100, 100, 0)

  Note over Client: Lands on a community page, <br> immediately checks membership <br> status in background

  Client->>API: PUT /refresh-membership body: <br> (user, chain, address, topicId)

  Note over API: Checks membership status of address, <br> for group(s), on specified topic. <br><br> If membership missing or stale, <br> compute membership status, <br> save and return membership <br><br> If membership fresh, <br> return membership. <br><br> Membership model (saved to DB): <br><br> group_id: number <br> address_id: number <br> allowed: boolean <br> reject_reason?: string <br> last checked: Date

  API-->>Client: Response payload: <br><br> topic_id: number <br> allowed: boolean <br> reject_reason?: string

  Note over Client: If address not allowed on topic, <br>  show banner with reject reason

  end
```

## User Performs Mutation Action

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

  rect rgb(100, 0, 0)

  Note over Client: Attempts to perform gated action, <br> (e.g. create thread, create comment)

  Client->>API: Request <br> body: (user, address, chain, â€¦data)

  Note over API: Checks membership status of address, <br> for group(s), on thread's topic, <br> using validateGroupMembership. <br><br> Always compute membership status and save. <br><br> If rejected, save Membership.reject_reason <br> and throw unauthorized error <br><br> If allowed, proceed with action.

   alt Rejected
        API-->>Client: { error: <reject reason> }
    else Success
        API-->>Client: Normal response payload
    end

  end
```

## Create Group

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

  rect rgb(0, 20, 0)

  Note over Client: Admin creates a Group

  Client->>API: POST /groups <br> body: (user, chain, address, metadata, requirements, topics)

  Note over API: Validate schema. <br><br> Check limit of 20 groups per chain. <br><br> Save group <br><br> Optionally add group to each specified topic.

  API-->>Client: Response payload (Group): <br><br> id: number <br> chain_id: string <br> metadata: MetadataJSON <br> requirements: RequirementsJSON

  end
```

## View Group Memberships

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

  rect rgb(0, 0, 20)

  Note over Client: Admin views Group Memberships page

  Client ->> API: GET /groups?chain_id=XXX&members=true <br>(no auth)

  Note over API: Gets all allowed memberships, <br> for all groups, for all topics <br> in the community. <br><br> No compute, only DB query. <br><br> Rejected memberships are not returned (?).

  API -->> Client: Response payload (Group w/ members): <br><br> id: number <br> chain_id: string <br> metadata: MetadataJSON <br> requirements: RequirementsJSON <br> members?: { <br> group_id: number <br> address_id: number <br> allowed: true <br> last checked: Date<br>}[]

  end
```

## Update/delete Group

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

  rect rgb(0, 0, 50)

  Note over Client: Admin updates/deletes Group

  Client ->> API: DELETE /groups/:id <br> body: (user, chain, address)

  Note over API: Deletes all Memberships of the group, <br> then updates/deletes the group.

  API -->> Client: OK

  end
```
