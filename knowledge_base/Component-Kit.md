Figma is our single source of truth.

The component kit is Engineeringâ€™s current implementation of that source of truth. Whenever the Figma version of the kit is updated, changes should be ticketed for Engineering and implemented.

A rendered version of our component kit can be [viewed on the live site](https://commonwealth.im/components), or found in the codebase in the `component_kit` directory.
