E2E tests assess an app from the userâ€™s perspective, locating and interacting with elements on rendered pages.

## Writing E2E Tests

E2E tests are written in the Playwright framework, consisting of element-locator methods (e.g. `page.locator`), element-interaction methods (e.g. `.click`), and expectations (e.g. `expect(page).toHaveTitle`). A more complete list can be found in [Playwright's Docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests).

The Playwright Inspector GUI's auto-gen functionality allows you to interact (as you normally would) with the site, constructing a series of tests that replicate your interactions.

## Example Test

```js
test('Can click on Sign in button', async ({ page: Page }) => {
  await page.goto(`http://localhost:${PORT}/`);
  const loginButton = await page.locator('.desktop-login');
  await loginButton.click();

  const loginModal = await page.locator('.LoginDesktop');
  expect(loginModal).toBeTruthy();
});
```

## File Structure

E2E tests are housed in the following subdirectories of `/test/E2E`:

- `/E2EStateful`: This relies on the DB to be set up with a dump of the test entities.

- `/E2ESerial`: The tests in this suite will be run in serial (Avoids race conditions).

- `/E2ERegular`: The tests in this suite are set up with a default empty DB (need to make your own test entities) as well as being run in parallel.

Corresponding package scripts for running tests may be found in [Package-Scripts.md](../knowledge_base/Package-Scripts.md).

At the file level, each testing file should represent one and only one URI route. See for example `discussions.spec.ts`. This file should only ever navigate to `/discussions`.

## General Tips for Writing E2E Tests

- Try to make locators as general and robust as possible, locating by class name rather than, e.g. the element's inner text.

- Avoid using index-based locating for buttons (e.g. "3rd item in list") unless the list is used to display data.

- Avoid using `while` loops to wait for an assertion flow. Instead use `expect(...).toPass()`.

- Add reusable functions in the `E2EUtils` file.

- If you are using `E2EDbEntityHooks`, avoid relying on specific ordering properties, as test order cannot be ensured.

- Don't delete any entities from the `entityHooks` during runtime. This ensures other tests can use them. If you want to test deletion, first create the entity yourself instead, to be deleted in the test.

- Testing should be fast. We should build them in a way where we can trade off compute power for time.

## Running E2E Tests

Local development is preferred over CI development. We should make use of all the threads in order to run tests. This is especially important for E2E testing, as most of the time is spent waiting.

### Locally

To run E2E tests locally you must first run `E2E-start-server`. When the server is ready, run `test-E2E`.

- `E2E-start-server`: Starts the server and injects a mocked metamask object. It allows you to have a default
metamask account without needing to have the metamask extension installed.

- `test-E2E`: Runs playwright on all the tests in the E2E folder.

### On CI

Because we can't manually check if the server has started, we rely on `wait-server` to wait for the server to be ready before we run the `test-E2E`.

## Debugging E2E Tests

When E2E tests fail, we record a video of the failed run. These videos can be viewed and navigated via Playwright's [Trace Viewer](https://trace.playwright.dev/).

- If you add `--debug` to the `test-E2E` command, it will open a debug box which will allow you to step through the code line by line, and allow you to test locators to see which elements it will grab. `npx playwright test --debug ...`

- Locally: These video is stored in the test-results folder. They are named after the name of the test that failed and produced it.

- CI: These videos are stored in the artifacts. They can be found and downlaoded at the bottom of the summary page.
