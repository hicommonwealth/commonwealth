# Overview

E2e tests are tests that are ran as if the user was clicking around on the webpage. E2e tests are written in the
playwright framework.

# Running e2e tests

## Locally

To run e2e tests locally you need to first run `e2e-start-server`. When the server is ready run `test-e2e`.

* `e2e-start-server`: Starts the server and injects a mocked metamask object. It allows you to have a default
metamask account without needing to have the metamask extension installed.
* `test-e2e`: Runs playwright on all the tests in the e2e folder.

## On CI

Because we can not be there to manually check if the server had started, we rely on the `wait-server` to wait for
the server to be ready before we run the `test-e2e`.

# Writing e2e Tests

## File Structure

Tests are broken down as follows:

## Folder level

* `e2eStateful`: This relies on the DB to be set up with a dump of the test entities
* `e2eSerial`: The tests in this suite will be run in serial (Avoids race conditions)
* `e2eRegular`: The tests in this suite are set up with a default empty DB (need to make your own test entities) as well as being run in parallel.

## File level

Each file should represent only one route. See for example `discussions.spec.ts`. This file should only ever navigate
to `/discussions`.

## General Tips

* Try to make locators as general as possible to make the tests robust. To do this, try to locate on a property like class
or ID.
* Avoid using index based locating for buttons (Like 3rd item in list) unless the list is used to display data.
* Avoid using while loops to wait for a assertion flow. Instead use `expect(...).toPass()`.
* Add reusable functions in the e2eUtils file.
* If you are using `e2eDbEntityHooks`, avoid relying on specific ordering properties, as the tests run in any order.
So the ordering could be out of place, or previously ran tests could modify it.
* Don't delete any entities from the `entityHooks` during runtime. This ensures other tests can use them. If you want to test deletion, first create the entity yourself instead, then you can delete your own entity during the test.

# Debugging e2e Tests

When e2e tests fail, we record a video of the failed run.

* If you add `--debug` to the `test-e2e` command, it will open a debug box which will allow you to step through the code
line by line, and allow you to test locators to see which elements it will grab. `npx playwright test --debug ...`
* Locally: These video is stored in the test-results folder. They are named after the name of the test that failed
and produced it.
* CI: These videos are stored in the artifacts. They can be found and downlaoded at the bottom of the summary page.
