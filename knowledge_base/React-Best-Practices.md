# React Best Practices & Improvements

- ⚠️ This entry intentionally stays silent on state management. See [State Management](./State-Management.md) entry instead.
- ⚠️ This entry is not oriented toward performance improvements. It is concerned with improving developer experience, increasing readability, and aligning our codebase with current React standards.
- ⚠️ This entry discusses aspirational ideals for our codebase, and is not a descriptive documentation of how our codebase is currently organized. Strong divergences between ideal and actual have been explicitly flagged, but few or none of the practices  delineated are consistently or fully implemented in our present codebase (230815).

## Directory Structure

As of 240416, our frontend's directory structure is derived from the MVC model, with which React has little in common, and from which we want to gradually move away.

### Components

All reusable components (i.e. components that may be invoked multiple times across the app) are kept in the `/components` folder.

Each component is housed in a separate, component-scoped folder named in PascalCase convention. (Currently, this naming convention is unevenly implemented, and many instances of snake_case remain.)

- e.g. `/Button`, `/ProposalCard` etc.

In each folder there should be an `index.ts` (not `.tsx`) file that exports `.tsx` components from within the folder. All file imports should go through this index file, rather than importing directly from the component file.

- e.g. `import { AvatarUpload, Avatar} from 'components/Avatar`

Aspirationally, components' respective `.scss` files should be placed next to the components and should share a name with the component it belongs to

- e.g. `client/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.scss`

#### Skeleton components

Skeleton components should be defined in separate files, in the same directory as their non-skeleton equivalents, referencing the name of their non-skeleton equivalents (e.g. `ComponentSkeleton` should be defined in `ComponentSkeleton.tsx`, which should be housed alongside `Component.tsx`).

Skeleton components should be returned via a conditional `if` statement, e.g. `if (loading) return <ComponentSkeleton />`.

#### Example component directory structure

```text
└── components
    ├── Button
    │   ├── index.ts
    │   ├── Button.tsx
    │   └── Button.scss
    └── Sidebar
        ├── index.ts
        ├── Sidebar.tsx
        ├── SidebarSkeleton.tsx
        ├── Sidebar.scss
        └── QuickSwitcher
            ├── index.ts
            ├── QuickSwitcher.tsx
            ├── QuickSwitcherSkeleton.tsx
            └── QuickSwitcher.scss
```

### Pages

Aspirationally, only those components serving as entry points for routes are housed in this directory.

Each folder should demarcate a separate route.

- `snake_case` is not an appropriate naming convention for folders. We should use either `PascalCase` or `kebab-case`.

The central component of a given route-scoped folder should not be defined in `index.ts`, but rather in a separate file (e.g. `Component.tsx`). The `index.ts` file should instead be reserved for exporting any components in its parent folder

As in the `/components` folder, all stylesheets (i.e. `.scss` files) should housed be in the same folder as `.ts` and `.tsx` page files.

## Component file composition

This section looks at best practices for how to organize code within a component file.

### General organization

A component's name should be identical to the file name.

Files should not house more than a single component.

#### Imports

We should move towards configuring our eslint library to perform automatic import sorting. There are many plugins that would make our job easier; see [here](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-sort-imports-in-react-project-550f5ce70cbf).

#### Props

Each component should define a props interface immediately above the component definition.

This interface should take the naming structure `ComponentProps`, e.g. `AvatarUploadProps`.

Props should be immediately destructured within the Component's definition.

#### Hooks and Utils

Ideally, we should extract business logic to custom hooks and utils that are responsible for fetching, storing and manipulating data. This way, we follow the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle).

Hooks and utils should be defined in separate files, close to the component (i.e. in the same subdirectory). If a hook or util function begins to be used by multiple pages or components, it should be moved to our `/utils` and `/helpers` directories.

React hooks (e.g. `useEffect`) should be invoked as early as possible in the component definition, at the component's top level of context, i.e. not nested inside conditionals, loops, or other logic. See the [React hooks rules](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).

We should favour using `useState` or `useEffect` instead of `React.useState` or `React.useEffect`. The same goes for other methods imported from the React packages.

We currently overuse `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`. Passing exact dependencies as eslint suggests makes sense in the vast majority of situations; if your dependency array causes an infinite loop, it means that either the logic is poorly designed, or the dependency needs to be wrapped in `useMemo`/`useCallback`.

#### Markup readability

Components should be kept as concise and readable as possible. If the component requires more complex logic, this logic should be moved to util functions in a separate file.

We should place as little logic as possible in the component's `return`, as this area houses the markup/UI of the component and should be optimized for readability.

- E.g., all calculations should be made in the component body prior to the `return`; there result can be assigned to const for later reference.
  
The same is true for event handler definitions, like `onClick`. Define the handler functions in the component body and reference them in the `return`.

#### Example component composition

An example of a simple component, child component, and custom hook.

```tsx
// file Component.tsx

interface ComponentProps = {
  title: string;
  id: number;
}

const Component = ({ title, id }: ComponentProps) => {
  const { items, loadItems } = useComponent();

  const handleClick = () => {
    loadItems();
    // more logic
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Item key={item.id} title={item.title} id={item.id} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Component
```

```tsx
// file Item.tsx

const Item = ({ title, id }: Interface) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{id}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Item
```

```ts
// file useComponent.ts

const useComponent = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

  const loadItems = async () => {
    const response = await axios('url');
    setItems(response.data);
  };

  return { loadItems, items };
};

export default useComponent
```

## StrictMode

When a React application is wrapped in `React.StrictMode`, React performs extra checks and validations during development mode. These checks include:

- Identifying components with unsafe lifecycle methods and providing warnings about them.
- Detecting legacy string ref usage and warning about it.
- Detecting deprecated findDOMNode usages and warning about it.
- Detecting unexpected side effects within the render phase and warning about it.
- Detecting a few other potential issues.
