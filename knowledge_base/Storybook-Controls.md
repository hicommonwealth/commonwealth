Storybook Controls gives us a graphical UI to interact with a component's arguments dynamically without needing to code. It creates an addon panel next to the component examples ("stories"), so we can edit them live.

To use Controls addon, all we need to do is to write the stories using [args](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/args). Storybook will automatically generate UI controls based on the args provided and what it can infer about the component.
