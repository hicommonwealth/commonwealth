* start - Used to start the commonwealth app in development. Runs both the backend and frontend server.
* db-all - Given a db-dump, reset your database and add its data to your database.
* e2e-codegen - Start playwrights codegen. This will open up a chrome window and allow you to click around on the screen and autogenerate playwright code according to what actions you perform on the screen. [Loom example](https://www.loom.com/share/b1b36c7d7fae4b079b380ec2a61da25c)
