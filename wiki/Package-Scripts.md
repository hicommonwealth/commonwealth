This entry documents [the Commonwealth package.json file](../packages/commonwealth/package.json). `Package.json` scripts should always be organized alphabetically. If you add a script, you *must* add documentation in this file describing (1) what it does (2) when engineers might use it.

# Build Scripts

## build-all

Definition: `yarn build-app && yarn build-consumer`

Description: Builds app based on webpack.prod.config.js file, as well as the build-consumer script

Considerations: Merely an aggregate script of `build-app` and `build-consumer`; may not be necessary. **Flagged for possible removal.**

## build-app
    
Definition: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096 webpack --config webpack/webpack.prod.config.js --progress`

Description: Builds project, allocating max 4096MB memory to Node; runs webpack based on webpack.prod.config.js file.

## build:css

Definition: `NODE_ENV=production build client/styles/shared.scss` 

Considerations: Why do we have a separate CSS build? Who uses it? And does it even work? We don't appear to have a `build` command that it could modify. **Deprecated; recommend removal.**

## heroku-postbuild

Definition: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=$(../../scripts/get-max-old-space-size.sh) webpack --config webpack/webpack.prod.config.js --progress && yarn build-consumer`

Description: Builds project on Heroku, using `get-max-old-space-size.sh` to dynamically allocate memory, then running webpack and the [build-consumer](#build-consumer) script

# CI Scripts

## start-ci

Definition: `FETCH_INTERVAL_MS=500 ts-node --project tsconfig.json server.ts`

Description: Used by our CI tool to start the server.

Considerations: What is the purpose of scripts (which are developer-friendly shorthand) being used for CI? Why not just directly reference the full definition in our `CI.yml` file? **Flagged for possible removal.**

## wait-server

Definition: `chmod +x ./scripts/wait-server.sh && ./scripts/wait-server.sh`

Description: Used for CI. Waits for the server to be ready (start serving on port 8080).

Contributor: Kurtis Assad

Considerations: What is the purpose of scripts (which are developer-friendly shorthand) being used for CI? Why not just directly reference the full definition in our `CI.yml` file? **Flagged for possible removal.**

# Database Scripts

## clean-db

Definition: `ts-node --project tsconfig.json server/scripts/cleanDb.ts`

Description: This executes series of 'cleaner' functions that delete unnecessary data from the database, particularly notification and subscription data. For more documentation, see databaseCleaner.ts. On prod, the cleaner functions run daily. 

Considerations: Engineers will almost never need to use this locally (unless they have purposefully create a large number of test notifications). This script was authored at the request of Jake Naviasky; we should confer with him as to the long-term value of this script. **Flagged for possible removal.**

Contributor: Timothee Legros

## create-migration

Definition: `npx sequelize migration:generate --name`

Description: Generates a new database migration file, taking a passed argument in kebab-case as a name (e.g. `yarn create-migration remove-user-last-visited-col`).

## db-all

Definition: `yarn reset-db && yarn load-db && yarn migrate-db`

Description: Resets, loads, and migrates db (composite script).

Contributor: Kurtis Assad

## dump-db

Definition: `pg_dump $(heroku config:get CW_READ_DB -a commonwealth-beta) --verbose --exclude-table-data=\"public.\\\"Subscriptions\\\"\" --exclude-table-data=\"public.\\\"Sessions\\\"\" --exclude-table-data=\"public.\\\"DiscussionDrafts\\\"\" --exclude-table-data=\"public.\\\"LoginTokens\\\"\" --exclude-table-data=\"public.\\\"Notifications\\\"\" --exclude-table-data=\"public.\\\"SocialAccounts\\\"\" --exclude-table-data=\"public.\\\"Webhooks\\\"\" --exclude-table-data=\"public.\\\"NotificationsRead\\\"\" --no-privileges --no-owner -f latest.dump`

Description: Creates a database dump file, `latest.dump`, from Heroku's commonwealth-beta db, excluding several tables such as DiscussionDrafts, Subscriptions, Notifications, and SocialAccounts.

## dump-db-limit

Definition: `yarn run dump-db && psql $(heroku config:get CW_READ_DB -a commonwealth-beta) -a -f limited_dump.sql`

Description: In addition to running the [dump-db](#dump-db) script, this copies a limited set of Notification and Subscription data from the commonwealth-beta Heroku database. Used in conjunction with the [load-db-limit](#load-db-limit) script.

## dump-db-local

Definition: `pg_dump -U commonwealth --verbose --no-privileges --no-owner -f local_save.dump`

Description: Exports the local Postgres database to a dump file, `local_save.dump`.

## load-db 

Definition: `chmod u+x scripts/load-db.sh && ./scripts/load-db.sh`

Description: Loads database following the `load-db.sh` script. Looks for dump file `latest.dump` by default; if script is called with an argument, the value of DUMP_NAME will be updated to that argument's value.

## load-db-limit 

Definition: `yarn run reset-db && yarn run load-db && psql -d commonwealth -U commonwealth -a -f limited_load.sql`

Description: Used in conjunction with [dump-db-limit](#dump-db-limit), this loads a dumped copy of the commonwealth-beta Heroku database alongside a limited, copied set of Notification and Subscription rows.

## load-db-local

Definition: `psql -d commonwealth -U commonwealth -W -f local_save.dump`

Description: Loads local database from a dump file, `local_save.dump`.

## migrate-db

Definition: `npx sequelize db:migrate`

Description: Migrates database, using migration files in `./server/migration` directory.

## migrate-db-down

Definition: `npx sequelize db:migrate:undo`

Description: Undoes the last-run Sequelize migration.

## migrate-server

Definition: `heroku run npx sequelize db:migrate --debug`

Description: Runs a database migration on the Heroku dyno in debug mode.

Considerations: The current script name does not sufficiently indicate its relationship to Heroku.

## psql

Definition: `chmod u+x scripts/start-psql.sh && ./scripts/start-psql.sh`

Description: Start a PostgreSQL instance.

## reset-db

Definition: `chmod u+x scripts/reset-db.sh && ./scripts/reset-db.sh`

Description: Resets the local database.

## reset-frack-db 

Definition: `heroku pg:copy commonwealth-beta::CW_READ_DB DATABASE_URL --app commonwealth-frack --confirm commonwealth-frack`

Description: Synchronizes `beta-db` (used for QA) against the `frack-db` (used for CDN cache testing). Good for undoing migration script run in previous commit to Frack. See [Testing Environments](./Testing-Environments.md) entry for more info.

# Docker

## start-containers

Definition: `chmod +rx ./scripts/start-docker-containers.sh && ./scripts/start-docker-containers.sh`

Description: Starts remote Docker containers; see [start-docker-containers.sh](../packages/commonwealth/scripts/start-docker-containers.sh) for further documentation.

## start-docker-setup

Definition: `chmod +rx ./scripts/start-docker-setup-help.sh && ./scripts/start-docker-setup-help.sh`

Description: To be run in a new project or repo when first setting up remote docker containers. See [start-docker-setup-help.sh](../packages/commonwealth/scripts/start-docker-setup-help.sh) for further documentation.

# Linting & Formatting

Open considerations: Given our Prettier pre-commit hook, this amount of linting and formatting commands may be unnecessary. 

## format

Definition: `prettier --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore --config ../../.prettierrc.json --write .`

Description: Autoformats files using config `prettierrc.json` config.

## lint

Definition: `./scripts/lint-new-work.sh`

Description: Lints new work, according to script file `lint-new-work.sh`. 

Considerations: Problematically, only checks .ts files. Name is misleading. Redundancy with [lint-branch](#lint-branch) script. **Flagged for possible removal.**

## lint-all

Definition: `eslint client/\\**/*.{ts,tsx} server/\\**/*.ts`

Description: Only lints changed files on current branch. 

Considerations: May be more clearly renamed "lint-changes".

## lint-branch

Definition: `./scripts/lint-branch.sh`

Description: Redundant with [lint](#lint) script, which uses 'git status' instead of 'git diff' but is build toward the same action (isolating changed files for linting).

Considerations: Recommend eliminating either [lint](#lint) or [lint-branch](#lint-branch) scripts. Problematically, lint-branch only checks .ts files. **Flagged for possible removal.**

## style-lint

Definition: `stylelint client/styles/*`

Description: Lints SCSS files.

Considerations: Why lint styles separately? Why not just include `.scss` file extension in [lint](#lint) and [lint-all](#lint-all) scripts (which currently only target `.ts` files)? **Flagged for possible removal.**

# Mobile

Open considerations: Are these still in use?

## build-android

Description: Helper script to complete DataDog Postgres account setup, scripts, and required config. Allows us Heroku database monitoring and stats. See [ReadMe](../packages/commonwealth/README.md) for more information on using DataDog.

Contributor: Nakul Manchanda

## send-notification-digest-emails

Definition: `SEND_EMAILS=true ts-node --project tsconfig.json server.ts`

Description: Schedules a daily task for sending notification email digests.

Considerations: Script name might be worth shortening.

## start-prerender

Definition: `ts-node --project tsconfig.json server/scripts/runPrerenderService.ts`

Considerations: Referenced prerender script no longer exists. **Deprecated; recommend removal.** 

# Playwright

Definition: `storybook dev -p 6006`

Description: Compiles and serves a development build of Storybook reflecting source code changes in-browser in real time, at localhost:6006.

Contributor: Daniel Martins

# Testing

Open considerations:
- When and why do we invoke `nyc` and `NODE_ENV=test` in our scripts? No clear rhyme or reason to our use.
  - `nyc` runs IstanbulJS, which tracks and reports how much of our source code is covered by tests. `NODE_ENV=test` sets a global variable that changes how select parts of our wallet and chain infrastructure runs.
- Do we need so many different scripts for specifying which part of the codebase we want to test? Would a generic test script, taking a directory as argument, suffice?
  - See e.g. [test-select](#test-select)
- Any test scripts we remove, we should ensure their respective invocations in `CI.yml` are replaced with appropriate definitions.

## integration-test

Definition: `nyc ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json ./test/integration/**/*.spec.ts`

Description: Runs all tests in our integration folder and its subdirectories.

Considerations: This script breaks our more usual test script syntax, which typically begin with the "test-" prefix followed by the directory tested. We should also keep an eye on similar integration-scoped test scripts; there may be redundancies.

## test

Definition: `nyc ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json ./test/**/*.spec.ts`

Description: Runs all tests in our /test directory.

## test-api

Definition: `NODE_ENV=test nyc ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json ./test/integration/api/**/*.spec.ts`

Description: Runs all tests in the /api subfolder of the /integration directory.

## test-client

Definition: `webpack-dev-server --config webpack/webpack.config.test.js`

Description: Ostensibly used to test only client-side code.

Considerations: The `webpack.config.test.js` file referenced does not exist. **Deprecated; recommend removal.**

## test-consumer

Definition: `ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json test/systemTests/consumer.test.ts --timeout 20000`

Considerations: The `consumer.test.ts` file referenced does not exist. **Deprecated; recommend removal.**

## test-devnet

Definition: `nyc ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json ./test/devnet/**/*.spec.ts`

Description: Runs all tests in our `/devnet`` folder.

## test-emit-notif 

Definition `NODE_ENV=test nyc ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json ./test/integration/emitNotifications.spec.ts`

Description: Runs only the `emitNotifications.spec.ts` test, of the three `/integration`` folder "utils."

## test-events

Definition: `nyc ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json ./test/integration/events/*.spec.ts`

Description: Ostensibly used to test all events in our integration folder.

Considerations: Misleading name (should be integration-scoped). More importantly, we do not have an /events folder inside our /integration directory. **Deprecated; recommend removal.**

## test-integration-util

Definition: `NODE_ENV=test nyc ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json ./test/integration/*.spec.ts`

Description: Runs tests living in the top level of our integration folder, where we house tests that require "integrated" components (e.g. tests that need access to a live Postgres database or a live Redis instance, rather than to the mock Postgres or Redis instances we use in util testing). 

Considerations: The script name might misleadingly suggest that this script would pick out specifically the /util subfolder in the /integration directory. Might we be better off moving the three top-level scripts (e.g. databaseCleaner.spec.ts) into a dedicated subfolder, and targeting that?

Contributor: Timothee Legros

## test-query

Definition: `ts-node server/scripts/testQuery.ts`

Description: Executes testQuery.ts, which runs a select query on chains, for unclear-to-this-documentarian reasons.

Considerations: Why do we have this? Is a "test-" prefix name misleading, given that it is not, strictly speaking, a test (in the same sense as our ts-mocha scripts).

Contributor: Timothee Legros

## test-select

Definition: `NODE_ENV=test nyc ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json`

Description: Append a path to run specific test files or folders.

## test-suite

Definition: `NODE_ENV=test nyc ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json ./test/**/*.spec.ts`

Description: Runs all tests in our /test directory.

Considerations: This is equivalent to our `test` script but with `NODE_ENV=test` added. Why? Do we actually need both versions? **Flagged for possible removal.**

## unit-test

Definition: `NODE_ENV=test ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json './test/unit/**/*.spec.ts'`

Description: Tests all .spec files within the `./test/unit` sub-directory of test folder.

Considerations: This script breaks our more usual test script syntax, which typically begin with the "test-" prefix followed by the directory tested.

Contributor: Ryan Bennett

## unit-test:watch

Definition: `NODE_ENV=test ts-mocha --project tsconfig.json --opts test/mocha-dev.opts './test/unit/**/*.spec.ts' -w --watch-files '**/*.ts'`

Description: Watches for changes to any .spec files within `./test/unit` and automatically runs test when they are updated.

Considerations: This script breaks our more usual test script syntax, which typically begin with the "test-" prefix followed by the directory tested.

Contributor: Ryan Bennett

# TypeScript

## build-consumer

Definition: `tsc --project ./tsconfig.consumer.json && tsc-alias --project ./tsconfig.consumer.json`

Description: Runs a compilation based on tsconfig.consumer.json; does not emit files; replaces alias with relative paths post-compilation.

## check-types

Definition: `tsc --noEmit`

Description: Runs a compilation of TypeScript files based on tsconfig.json; does not emit files.

# Webpack && TSNode

## bundle-report    

Definition: `webpack-bundle-analyzer --port 4200 build/stats.json`
    
Description:  Runs webpack-bundle-analyzer library to display breakdown of bundle size & makeup, hosted on port 4200 (localhost:4200). To generate a stats.json file, navigate to [webpack.prod.config.js](../packages/commonwealth/webpack/webpack.prod.config.js), set the `generateStatsFile` key to true, run `yarn build` , and finally `yarn bundle-report`.

## listen

Definition: `RUN_AS_LISTENER=true ts-node --project tsconfig.json server.ts`

Description: Runs ts-node, a TypeScript execution engine for NodeJS, in listening mode for changes, following tsconfig.json and using [server.ts](../packages/commonwealth/server.ts) as the entry file.

## profile 

Definition: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096 webpack --config webpack/webpack.dev.config.js --json --profile > webpack-stats.json`

Description: Runs build webpack analyzer. 

Considerations: **Deprecated; recommend removal.** Appears to be redundant with `bundle-report`. As of 22-08-03 #all-eng conversation, appears to be unused. See also [stats.sh](../packages/commonwealth/stats.sh) for possible removal.

## start

Definition: `ts-node-dev --max-old-space-size=4096 --respawn --transpile-only --project tsconfig.json server.ts`

Description: Windows-compatible start script. Used to start the Commonwealth app in development. 

## start-all

Definition: `concurrently -p '{name}' -c red,green -n app,consumer 'yarn start' 'yarn start-consumer'`

Description: Runs `yarn start` and `yarn start-consumer` (i.e., the main app server, and the CommonwealthConsumer script) concurrently with the `concurrently` package.

## start-consumer

Definition: `ts-node --project ./tsconfig.consumer.json server/CommonwealthConsumer/CommonwealthConsumer.ts run-as-script`

Description: Runs `CommonwealthConsumer.ts` script, which consumes & processes RabbitMQ messages from external apps and services. See script file for more complete documentation.
