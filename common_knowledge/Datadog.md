# Datadog

We use Datadog for three things: metrics, alerts, and ingesting logs from Heroku.

The Datadog dashboard can be located at <https://us5.datadoghq.com>. NB: We use the US5 region; attempts to login and access the dashboard from other regions will silently fail.

As of 240102, only the main dashboard can be trusted for accurate data reports. Many of the autogenerated dashboards report data differently, leading to inconsistency and errors.

## Metrics

In our codebase, we use the [Stats](../libs/core/src/ports/index.ts) port to increment counters and add tags.

For instance, every time `TokenBalanceCache` successfully fetches, we call `.increment` on the controller and then tag the count accordingly. Tags allow us to easily locate the relevant metrics from Datadog's dashboard and generate graphic visualizations.

## Alerts

Every Heroku dyno emits a service heartbeat to Datadog every X seconds (e.g. 30, 60) to say “I’m alive.” If the heartbeat isn’t received, Datadog emits an alert to our #eng-feed-datadog Slack channel.

## Ingesting & Remapping Heroku Logs

Because we host through Heroku, we cannot set up raw metrics the way we normally might in Datadog. Metrics set up from the Datadog dashboard, using the provided member usage or CPU usage statistics, will be inaccurate — since the metrics reported are taken from the underlying server instance, and not from the relevant dyno container.

To set up dyno-scoped metrics on Datadog:

1. Enable Heroku Labs Dyno Metadata and Heroku Labs Log Runtime metrics. Heroku will log dyno metrics directly into our regular log feed.

2. Set up Datadog to parse these logs and extract the data we need from them. Datadog ingests logs from Heroku in raw format and passes them through a pipeline which parses and remaps the log metrics. (Heroku buildpack takes care of this pipeline for us.) To display these metrics on the main dashboard, we need to create a Datadog Measure. A Datadog Measure is a key-value pair consisting of a number and reference string (name). To create a new Measure from the dashboard, select a log from the log feed, open the event attributes tab, select the parsed value from the available event attributes, navigate to “Create Measure,” name it, and click "Add."

For general Heroku documentation, see our dedicated [Common Knowledge entry](./Heroku.md).

### Postgres Metrics

To enable Postgres metrics, the environment variable `DD_ENABLE_HEROKU_POSTGRES` must be set to `true` in Heroku.

For a list of available `postgresql` metrics, see <https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/postgres/?tab=host#metrics>. Since we use Heroku, not all these metrics will be reported and accessible; the only way to know is to create a metric and find out.

For more information, see Datadog's [Postgres Guide](
https://docs.datadoghq.com/database_monitoring/guide/heroku-postgres).

### Redis Metrics

To enable Redis metrics, the environment variable `DD_ENABLE_HEROKU_REDIS` must be set to `true` in Heroku. This will automatically trigger Redis metrics ingestion.

For a list of the metrics available on `redis`, see <https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/redisdb/?tab=host#metrics>. Since we use Heroku, not all these metrics will be reported and accessible; the only way to know is to create a metric and find out.

### RabbitMQ Metrics

To set up the RabbitMQ metrics, navigate to "Resources" from the Heroku dashboard. Then pull up CloudAMQP, navigate to the "Integrations" tab listed in the sidebar. Next, navigate to "Logs & Metrics"; from the Metrics section, add Datadog v2 integration.

For a list of the metrics available on `rabbitmq`, see <https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/rabbitmq/?tab=host#metrics>. Since we use Heroku, not all these metrics will be reported and accessible; the only way to know is to create a metric and find out.

For more complete RabbitMQ documentation, see our dedicated [Common Knowledge entry](./RabbitMQ.md).

## Configuration Prerequisites

These steps detail our Datadog-Heroku setup, in case it needs to be redone.

`Warning:` Following steps below may lead your app to restart several times; please choose an appropriate maintainance window.

See also Datadog's [Heroku Agent Guide](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/basic_agent_usage/heroku/).

1. Set the following environment variables:

    ```bash
      DD_AGENT_MAJOR_VERSION=7
      DD_API_KEY=<SECRET-DATADOG-ACCOUNT-KEY>
      DD_DYNO_HOST=true
      DD_LOG_LEVEL=WARN
      DD_SITE=us5.datadoghq.com
      DD_ENABLE_HEROKU_POSTGRES=true
      DD_ENABLE_HEROKU_REDIS=true
    ```

2. Install the Datadog buildpack. Copy the following URL on Heroku App settings page using `Add Buildpack` button: <https://github.com/Datadog/heroku-buildpack-datadog.git>.

3. Verify on Datadog. Visit <https://us5.datadoghq.com/dashboard/lists> for all available dashboards. If the Datadog agent has successfully picked up the Postgres config, you will see your app database name in the top dropdown of the Postgres dashboards.
