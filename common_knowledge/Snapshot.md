# Snapshot

## Setting up Snapshot Spaces

### Requirements

- Snapshot is only compatible with Ethereum communities. You must be an admin of an Ethereum-based community to work with the new Snapshot space.

- The Ethereum wallet you use must have an ENS (Ethereum Name Service) domain. Domains can be set up at <https://app.ens.domains/>. To register a domain, you must have Eth in a wallet connected to Mainnet, and will be prompted to perform a series of timed transactions.

### Setup

1. Change your wallet address to Eth Mainnet.

2. Go to <https://snapshot.org/#/setup?step=0>, connect your wallet via the "Connect wallet" button, and select "Get started."

3. Enter your ENS domain and select "Register."

4. Fill in profile info and continue.

5. On the strategy step, choose, 1-person 1-vote, and click "Next."

6. Select "Whitelist voting" and add your wallet address (or any other address you'd like to whitelist).

7. Click "Next" and add the addresses of any members (including your own) who will have permission to manage the space and create proposals. Click "Create".

8. Navigate to a community on Commonwealth in which you are an admin. Navigate to Manage Community Settings, and in the Snapshots field, add your ENS.

You should now be able to create Snapshot proposals with this test space.
