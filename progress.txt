[2026-02-04] #13341 fix: add graceful shutdown for modulith workers
- Files: server.ts, bootstrap.ts, relayForever.ts, graphileWorker.ts, workerLifecycle.ts, workerLifecycle.spec.ts, archiveOutbox.ts
- Changes: Added workerLifecycle module for coordinating worker shutdown. Workers register cleanup functions called on SIGTERM/SIGINT. Workers start in background to avoid blocking server. Fixed blocking execSync in archiveOutbox by converting to async exec.
- Decisions: Used Promise.all for parallel worker startup; 30s timeout for graceful shutdown; workers check isShutdownInProgress() flag.

[2026-02-06] #13354 fix: add Outbox table existence check before starting message relayer loop
- Files: relayForever.ts, bootstrap.ts, waitForOutboxTable.spec.ts
- Changes: Added waitForOutboxTable() with exponential backoff (1s-30s) that polls for Outbox table accessibility before relay loop starts. Called from bootstrapRelayer() so isServiceHealthy gates on DB readiness.
- Decisions: Placed readiness check in bootstrapRelayer (awaited) rather than inside fire-and-forget relayForever, so health check naturally gates on it.
