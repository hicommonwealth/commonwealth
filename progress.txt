[2026-02-04] #13341 fix: add graceful shutdown for modulith workers
- Files: server.ts, bootstrap.ts, relayForever.ts, graphileWorker.ts, workerLifecycle.ts, workerLifecycle.spec.ts, archiveOutbox.ts
- Changes: Added workerLifecycle module for coordinating worker shutdown. Workers register cleanup functions called on SIGTERM/SIGINT. Workers start in background to avoid blocking server. Fixed blocking execSync in archiveOutbox by converting to async exec.
- Decisions: Used Promise.all for parallel worker startup; 30s timeout for graceful shutdown; workers check isShutdownInProgress() flag.
[2026-02-06] #13352 fix: use bind mounts for macos volumes
- Files: scripts/macos/cwup.sh, scripts/macos/cwdown.sh
- Changes: Switched macOS cwup.sh volumes to bind mounts under ~/.container-volumes with directory creation and permissive chmod for local dev; cwdown now removes those host directories.
