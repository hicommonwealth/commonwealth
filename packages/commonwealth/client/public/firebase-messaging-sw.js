// NOTE: this needs to be done in .js due to a Typescript issue which is a bit of
// a nightmare.  What's happening is that we can't use Typescript types as our
// 'libs' configuration requires 'ServiceWorker' but that means that both 'dom'
// and ServiceWorker types are available in two places which are wrong.  The dom
// APIs are available to the service worker (which is wrong) and the ServiceWorker
// APIs are available to React (the browser) which is also wrong.  Additionally,
// the types for the service worker are actually wrong and 'showNotification'
// does not appear to be in the ServiceWorker types.  To handle this properly
// we would need to upgrade our Typescript to 5.4.x and create a dedicated
// typescript package JUST for our service worker which I feel is a waste of time
// since our service worker is just one file and less than 100 lines of code
