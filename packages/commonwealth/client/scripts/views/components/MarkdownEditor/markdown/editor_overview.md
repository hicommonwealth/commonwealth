# Example of all supported markdown features

This is a basic demo of the markdown editor.

You can append to the URL ```?mode=desktop``` or ```?mode=mobile``` to test out a specific mode.

The mobile version works in a desktop browser but should really only be run inside a real mobile browser when verifying functionality.

When you hit submit, it will print the markdown to the console.

Image uploads are local and do not go to S3 to avoid polluting our S3 bucket.
