# Overview

Markdown Editor based on MDXEditor customized for our usage.

It supports desktop and mobile mode.

In desktop mode the UI is responsive and uses a static layout so it can
operate within the flow of a regular document.

In mobile mode it docks the toolbar above the keyboard.

# Fork

This is currently using the commonwealth-mdxeditor, which is a fork of the
mdx-editor package.

This is just temporary as I plan on merging this into the main MDXEditor when
we are done.

Right now the only change is a 'location' property added to the toolbar code
so that we can place the toolbar below the editor.

# Testing

## Desktop

- success: copy a .md file to the clipboard, try to paste it into the editor. It
  should insert the content at the editor's cursor

    - this works via a File object (not text) so it's important to test this path.

- success: drag a .md file on top of the editor.  The drag indicator should show
  up and cover the editor while you're dragging.  Then the file should be inserted
  at the cursor.

- success: use the 'Import markdown' button to upload a file.

- success: right click and copy an image in the browser, this should upload it
to the editor and insert it at the current point (I use msnbc.com for this as
their images are copyable and not CSS background images)

- success: take a screenshot, try to paste it into the editor. The upload
  indicator should show up.

- success: use the image button at the top to manually upload an image. The
  upload indicator should show up while this is happening.

- success: drop an image file.  Should upload it for us and not handle it as
  markdown.

- failure: copy multiple .md files ot the clipboard, try to paste into the editor.
  It should fail because we can't handle multiple .md files

## Mobile

It's probably best to test this on a REAL mobile browser (not on a desktop).

- The toolbar should be present at the bottom of the UI.

- They keyboard should stay on top of the keyboard.

## Viewer

- make sure images, tables, and code don't have UI control elements
