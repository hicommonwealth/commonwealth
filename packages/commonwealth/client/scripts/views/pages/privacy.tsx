          provide us with personal information when you interact or communicate
          with us, including when you sign up for the Service and through
          events, surveys, and marketing or promotional programs. You are not
          required to provide your personal information; however, if you choose
          not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use
          some or all of the features of our Service or we may not be able to
          fulfill your requested interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contributions you make.</strong> You may post, publish, or
          display information on public areas of our Service or transmitted to
          other users of the Service or third parties, such as comments,
          questions, messages, voting responses, polling responses, and other
          content or information that you generate, transmit, or otherwise make
          available on the Service, as well as associated metadata. Further, if
          you make a contribution to the blockchain networks via the Service, it
          will automatically become public. Your contributions are posted and
          transmitted to others at your own risk and are out of our control but
          are subject to our Terms of Use. Although we limit access to certain
          pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or
          impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other
          users of Service with whom you may choose to share your contributions.
          Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your contributions will
          not be viewed by unauthorized persons. Your contributions may reveal
          personal information about you so we encourage you understand the
          impact of your contributions, including to review how privacy and
          transparency on the blockchain network work.

          <strong>Automatic data collection.</strong> We, our service providers,
          and our business partners may automatically log information about you,
          your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with
          the Service, our communications and other online services.
        </p>

          <strong>Information we obtain from other third parties.</strong> We
          may collect personal information about you from other sources,
          including third parties, and combine that with information we collect
          through our Service. For example, a business partner may share your
          contact information with us if you have expressed interest in learning
          specifically about our products or services, or the types of products
          or services we offer. We may obtain your personal information from
          other third parties, such as marketing partners, third-party wallet
          providers, other customers or consumers, data providers, and data from
          activity and information that is publicly visible and/or accessible on
          blockchains or other public sources.
        </p>
        <p>

          including but not limited to GitHub or WalletConnect, or otherwise
          connect your account on the third-party platform or network to your
          account through the Service, we may collect information from that
          platform or network. For example, this information may include your
          GitHub username and profile picture. You may also have the opportunity
          to provide us with additional information via the third-party platform
          or network, such as a list of your friends or connections and your
          email address.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Data about others.</strong> Users of the Service may have the
          opportunity to refer friends or other contacts to us and share their
          contact information with us. Please do not refer someone to us or
          share their contact information with us unless you have their
          permission to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cookies and automated tools.</strong> We use cookies (a small
          text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and
          browser) and may use other automated tools such as pixels to track
          your interaction with our Service and to improve the experience of our
          Service, such as saving your preferences from visit to visit to
          present you with a customized version of the Website. Many web
          browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your
          web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
          being sent. However, certain features of our Service may not work if
          you delete or disable cookies.
        </p>
        <p>We may use the following types of cookies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Strictly Necessary:</i> These cookies are essential to operate
            the Service and provide you with services you have requested.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Functional:</i> These cookies enable certain features or
            non-essential functionality on our Service. For example, we might
            use these cookies to recognize you and remember your preferences or
            settings when you return to our Service so we can provide you with a
            more personalized experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Advertising Cookies:</i> These cookies allow us and third parties
            to learn more about you, including your use of our Service and other
            websites, and advertise products or services that might interest you
            as further indicated below.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Analytics Cookies:</i> These cookies help us and third parties
            understand how our Service are working and who is visiting our
            Service.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We and third parties may also use tools that enable us to track
          certain aspects of a user’s visit to our Service. This technology
          helps us better manage content on our Service by informing us what
          content is effective, how consumers engage with our Service, and how
          consumers arrive at and/or depart from our Service. The software
          typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1) “tracking
          pixels” and (2) “clear gifs.” Tracking pixels are pieces of executable
          code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity
          including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long
          the pages are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique
          identifiers which are embedded in web pages and email messages that
          track whether a user views a web page or email message. User activity
          information may be associated with additional information about a
          user’s session and personal information, if provided by the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you arrive at our Service by “clicking through” from another
          website, then certain information about you that you provided to that
          other website, such as the terms you searched that led you to our
          Service, may be transmitted to us and we may use it. You should review
          the Privacy Policy of any website from which you reached our Service
          to determine what information the operator collects and how it uses
          such information. We may retain information about you provided to us
          by other websites and will use it in accordance with this Privacy
          Policy. Such information may be associated with other Usage Data or
          personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Interest-based advertising.</strong> We may work with
          third-party advertisers, search providers, and ad networks
          (“Advertisers”) to learn more about you and show you ads or other
          content that we believe would be relevant to you. Advertisers may
          collect and use information about your use of our Service as well as
          other websites and services. These companies may use cookies and other
          online tracking technologies to collect and use your information. We
          and/or Advertisers may also append other data to the data collected by
          Advertisers to create an interest profile of individual users. Our
          Privacy Policy does not cover any use by an Advertiser of information
          that they may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown via our
          Service or on third-party websites. If you do not want to receive
          interest-based advertising, please see the subsection below titled
          “Targeted online advertising.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Information from advertisements.</strong> If you arrive at our
          Service via an advertisement (e.g., banner ad), we may collect
          information regarding the advertisement with which you interacted and
          your interactions (e.g., item clicked, date and time).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Social media widgets.</strong> Our Service may include social
          media features, such as the Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter
          widgets. These features may collect information about your IP address
          and the pages you visit on our Service as well as other personal
          information. A cookie may be set to ensure that these features
          properly function. These companies’ privacy policies govern your
          interactions with these features and you should review the relevant
          privacy policies before interacting with these features.

          users of the Service and the public. For example, we may use
          technologies like API to display or share information relating to your
          public activity on blockchains, or the public may have access to your
          information if you chose to make your profile or other personal
          information available to them through the Service, such as when you
          provide comments, reviews, or share other content. This information
          can be seen, collected and used by others, including being cached,

        <h2>Other sites, mobile applications and services</h2>
        <p>
          The Service may contain links to other websites, mobile applications,
          and other online services operated by third parties. These links are
          not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with,
          any third party. In addition, our content may be included on web pages
          or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated
          with us. We do not control third party websites, mobile applications
          or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions.
          Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the
          collection, use and sharing of your personal information. We encourage
          you to read the privacy policies of the other websites and mobile
          applications and online services you use.
        </p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          The security of your personal information is important to us. We
          employ a number of organizational, technical and physical safeguards
          designed to protect the personal information we collect. However,
          security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies
          and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
        </p>
        <h2>International data transfers</h2>
        <p>
          We are headquartered in the United States and have service providers
          in other countries, and your personal information may be transferred
          to the United States or other locations outside of your state,
          province, or country where privacy laws may not be as protective as
          those in your state, province, or country.
        </p>
        <p>
          European Union users should read the important information provided{' '}
          <u>below</u> about transfer of personal information outside of the
          European Union.
        </p>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
          As a general rule, children are not allowed to use the Service, and we
          do not collect personal information from them. We define
          &quot;children&quot; as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Residents outside of Europe: anyone under 13 years old; and</li>
          <li>
            Residents of Europe: anyone under 16 years old, or the age needed to
            consent to the processing of personal information in your country of
            residence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child
          without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian, we will delete
          it. We encourage parents with concerns to contact us.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we
          make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by
          updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the
          Service. We may, and if required by law will, also provide
          notification of changes in another way that we believe is reasonably
          likely to reach you, such as via e-mail (if you have an account where
          we have your contact information) or another manner through the
          Service. Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective
          upon our posting the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new
          changes on the Service (or as otherwise indicated at the time of
          posting). In all cases, your continued use of the Service after the
          posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of
          the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>California Shine the Light law</strong> (California Civil Code
          Section 1798.83). California residents may ask companies with whom
          they have formed a business relationship primarily for personal,
          family or household purposes to provide the names of third parties to
          which they have disclosed certain personal information (as defined
          under the Shine the Light law) during the preceding calendar year for
          their own direct marketing purposes and the categories of personal
          information disclosed. You may send us requests for this information
          via email to <a href="mailto:hello@common.xyz">hello@common.xyz</a>.
          In your request, you must include the statement &quot;Shine the Light
          Request,&quot; and provide your first and last name and mailing
          address and certify that you are a California resident. We reserve the
          right to require additional information to confirm your identity and
          California residency. Please note that we will not accept requests via

          <strong>Use for new purposes.</strong> We may use your personal
          information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where
          permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for
          which we collected it. If we need to use your personal information for
          an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable
          legal basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sensitive personal information.</strong> We ask that you not
          provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., information
          related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or
          other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal
          background or trade union membership) on or through the Service, or
          otherwise to us. If you provide us with any sensitive personal
          information to us when you use the Service, you must consent to our
          processing and use of such sensitive personal information in
          accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our
          processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must
          not submit such sensitive personal information through our Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Retention.</strong> We retain personal information for as long
          as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it,
          including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or
          reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for
          fraud prevention purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine the appropriate retention period for personal
          information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the
          personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use
          or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we
          process your personal information and whether we can achieve those
          purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we no longer require the personal information we have collected
          about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not
          possible (for example, because your personal information has been
          stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
          information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
          is possible. If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can
          no longer be associated with you), we may use this information
          indefinitely without further notice to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your rights. European data protection laws give you certain rights
          regarding your personal information. If you are located within the
          European Union, you may ask us to take the following actions in
          relation to your personal information that we hold:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal information. This
            enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold
            about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal information that
            we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
            inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to
            verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Request deletion</strong> of your personal information. This
            enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information when
            there is no legally valid reason for us to process it. You also have
            the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information
            when you have successfully exercised your right to object to
            processing (see below), when we may have processed your information
            unlawfully, or when we are required to erase your personal
            information to comply with local law. However, please note that we
            may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for
            specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable,
            at the time of your request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal information
            when we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third
            party) and there is something about your particular situation which
            makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it
            infringes your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the
            right to object when we are processing your personal information for
            marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
            compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which
            overrides your rights and freedoms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal
            information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of
            your personal information in the following scenarios:
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal information.
            This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your
            personal information in the following scenarios:
            <ul className="hollow-container">
              <li className="hollow-bullet">

                When our use of the data is unlawful, you do not want us to

            <strong>Withdraw consent</strong> at any time when we are relying on
