            On Commonwealth, threads leave space for your community members to
            engage in thoughtful conversation. Curate threads by grouping them
            into featured tags, or lock threads to a select group of community
            members.

            Commonwealth helps break down silos between chat apps like Discord,
            Telegram, and Riot by providing integrations for webhooks and
            bridges. Your community will be able to receive Commonwealth
            notifications wherever they are most comfortable.

            No matter what protocol you build on, give easy access to your
            project&apos;s most important on-chain actions like staking and
            voting. Commonwealth has a growing list of integrations--including
            Ethereum, NEAR, Cosmos, Substrate, and popular DAO frameworks like
            Aragon.

            Fork, develop, alter, share - Commonwealth is explicitly designed
            for open-source ecosystems. Existing solutions like chat and email
            lock your data, users, and brand into platforms you don&apos;t
            control. Default openness allows new members to discover you through
            SEO.

            Commonwealth combines all the features of your favorite tools into a
            single platform.
