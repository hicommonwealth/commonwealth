CommonARTICLE II: ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICE
Section 2.1 Description of the Service. Common offers a forum space where users can create and post written or image-based content for discussion. Features of the Services include:
Create a Community or Group: Users can create a community of their choice. There are no requirements from the user to create these bespoke communities aside from a name, a description, a founding member, and an image to associate with their community. Within these communities, users are free to create subgroups or “groups.” A user may gate content or access to specific functions within a community or group to certain users. Common takes no direct supervisory role over what kind of groups can be created or accessed or their value within a given community. Common
Forum: Common provides a forum wherein users can create profiles and engage each other with written text or images, and upvote that content. To engage with content users must be part of a community to be able to post within that community. A forum thread consists of an initial post, which links to the user that posted it. All ensuing comments are connected to the thread. Users can create a thread within a community by clicking “new thread.” Communities may post their own kind of threads, such as governance threads, protocol discussions, update threads, or random thread. There is no limit on the type of thread a community can create so long as that thread falls within the self-moderation rules of the community and these Terms. Users can upvote content within their community forum to make such content more easily discoverable to other users. Users can only upvote content within a community that they are a member of; however, upvoting content can and will affect how content is shown globally to users both within and outside of the originating community. Moderating a community on the Services is an unofficial voluntary position that is available to any Common user if they, or the communities they are members of, elect to do so. Moderators do not act on behalf of Common, nor are they able to act on behalf of Common or sign any third party agreements in the name of Common. Common is not responsible for moderating content within a community, so long as the groups do not violate these Terms.
Community Stake: Stake is an NFT asset that is created by a user when they engage with a Community Stake contract launched in a community on the Service. A user generates stake by purchasing or minting the stake from a smart contract with a designated funding token chosen by the community that has enabled stake. The visual image of the stake token is chosen at the time of stake enablement. If communities wish, they can deploy a Community Stake (henceforth, “stake”) smart contract on various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks. This contract allows users to buy (or mint) NFT tokens specific to that community on common using a predetermined cryptocurrency. These NFTs are “soulbound” to the user’s digital wallet that buys them, meaning that they cannot be transferred outside of the minting user’s wallet. Users who own stake have increased upvote power, or “vote weight”, within any community that they own stake in. If a user wishes to reduce their inventory of stake in a particular community, they must burn their stake NFTs with the originating smart contract. The cost and value of stake at acquisition and redemption are determined by a bonding curve that increases or decreases in price as more users acquire or reduce their amount of stake. By default, fees derived from Community Stake go to a fee router contract that directs the funds on behalf of the administrator’s address.
Contests: Contests receive funds either directly from users or from fees generated by buying or selling Stake. Contests, on a user set interval, will pay out from their pool of funds some percent to the contest winners. Winners are determined by votes that are weighted by a secondary “vote weight calculation” contract that is also onchain for transparency plus trustfulness purposes. With the launch of contests, fees are directed toward the contests’ prize pools, to be distributed by the contests to contest winners. The fee manager/router contract can divert a share of the stake derived fees to any number of addresses on the blockchain the stake is deployed. Fees generated from Stake and direct deposits to the contests are used as part of a prize pool for iterative content contests within a community. The most upvoted content will receive a payout from the contest in whatever cryptocurrency the community chose to use.
Onchain Transactions: Community Stake requires blockchain network transactions, from the administrators of the communities that found it, because they execute a transaction onchain to reserve their namespace and found their communities. Any user that acquires community stake does so by buying tokens from an onchain smart contract. When users sell the community stake, they burn the assets and redeem some value back from the smart contract. Users can buy or mint stake from a community stake contract with the smart contract’s required funding token. This token will appear in the user’s wallet whether it is a third party wallet the user signed up with. Users can redeem or burn their stake by engaging with the originating smart contract. When they redeem or burn their stake tokens, they are returned some value from the smart contract.
Section 2.2 License to the Service. Common grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the Services pursuant to these Terms.

We are in no way liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Wallet or as a result of your Wallet being compromised.

Common will never provide access to offers or promotions through discord messages or links, and you should never click on any link on discord to an offer or promotion claiming to be from common even if it appears to originate from common. You are solely responsible for any losses that arise from your clicking on any links from a third party, even if such third party appears to be common, and you are solely responsible for any losses arising from the theft or unauthorized use of your wallet credentials.
You should make contingency plans with respect to your Wallet in the event of your death or incapacity, otherwise you (and your executor, guardian, or heirs) may lose access to your Wallet, your account on the Service, and your NFTs and other purchases.
Section 2.5 User Content. You must not Post any User Content that violates these Terms or for which you do not have all the rights necessary to grant the licenses described herein. You represent and warrant that your User Content, the source and underlying materials used in creating the User Content, and our use of such content as permitted by these Terms, will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity. Common disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of providing User Content via the Services.

Section 2.6 Specific Rules for Images and Sound Recordings.

ARTICLE VI: DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Section 6.1 Agreement to Binding, Exclusive Arbitration. Except as set forth in Section 6.5, all unresolved claims, disputes and controversies directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with or directly or indirectly relating to this Agreement, any of the matters or transactions contemplated by this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, including any claim seeking to invalidate, or alleging that, all or any part of this Agreement is unenforceable, void or voidable), or your relationship with Common (such claims, disputes and controversies, collectively, "Disputes") shall be finally settled by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court, agency or other Governmental Authority, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes. The parties hereby acknowledge, represent and warrant that they understand that: (a) there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and, absent this mandatory provision, the parties would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial concerning Disputes; (b) in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation; (c) the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court; and (d) court review of an arbitration award is limited. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.1, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for Disputes within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. Prior to initiating a Dispute against Common, you agree to contact Common at [email] and provide a detailed statement of your proposed Dispute and resolution so that Common may attempt to resolve your Dispute prior to arbitration. If the parties have been unable to reach a resolution of your Dispute within sixty days after the date of Common’s receipt of your email, and you have acted in good faith to negotiate a settlement, you may submit your Dispute for arbitration in accordance with this Section 6. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during this sixty-day pre-Dispute negotiation period.
Section 6.2 Arbitration Procedures. Either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding by delivering written notice to the other party, whereupon the parties shall reasonably cooperate to select an arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and submit the relevant Dispute to such arbitrator. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within 30 days from the filing of a demand for arbitration, the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) shall appoint the arbitrator, provided such arbitrator has reasonable experience in transactions provided for in this Agreement and the Dispute. Any such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the AAA, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Arbitrations with an amount in controversy of less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) (USD) will be conducted before a single arbitrator without an opportunity for appeal. Arbitrations with an amount in controversy equal to or greater than one million dollars ($1,000,000) (USD) will be conducted before a panel of three arbitrators with an opportunity for appeal. There shall be limited discovery prior to the arbitration hearing as follows: (a) exchange of witness lists and copies of documentary evidence and documents relating to the issues to be arbitrated, (b) depositions of all party witnesses, and (c) such other depositions as may be allowed by the arbitrators upon a showing of good cause. The arbitrator(s) will issue a reasoned opinion accompanying their judgment. Each party will bear its own attorneys’ fees and other costs associated with the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Common may seek its attorneys' fees, costs and necessary disbursements in addition to any other relief to which such party may be entitled if the arbitrator determines your Dispute is frivolous. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and reasoned, and binding on the parties, and may be entered into by any party as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Section 6.3 Seat of Arbitration. The seat of arbitration shall be New York County, New York. The parties may mutually choose to have the arbitration of any Dispute conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or at a mutually agreed location other than New York County, New York. User hereby agrees to submit to the personal jurisdiction for any equitable action sought in any federal or state court in New York County, New York, including in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
Section 6.4 Confidentiality of Arbitration. Except to the extent necessary to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement or as otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties undertake to maintain confidentiality as to the existence, outcome, and events of the arbitration proceedings and as to all records, materials, submissions, correspondence and evidence relating to the arbitration proceedings. This provision shall survive the termination of the arbitral proceedings.
Section 6.5 Class Action Waiver. The parties agree that any arbitration or other permitted action with respect to any Dispute shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT SUCH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN SUCH PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
If any court or arbitrator(s) makes a final, binding and non-appealable determination that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void with respect to any Dispute that would thus be required to be resolved by arbitration on a class basis, and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate such Dispute. In the event that, as a result of the application of the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise, any Dispute is not subject to arbitration, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York County, New York and to accept service of process by certified or registered mail with respect to such Dispute, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available with respect to such Dispute. Each party will provide necessary then current contact information to facilitate service of process.

If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, inoperative or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity, illegality, inoperability or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and Common shall have the right to modify this Agreement to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consumed as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
