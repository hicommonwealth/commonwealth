          <strong>Users</strong>”) to interact with and manage Digital Wallets
          owned and/or controlled by such Users. Each Digital Wallet is a system
          of software-based smart contracts interoperable with software
          installed on and operated through a user device, which such system
          enables users to hold and transact in cryptocurrency and other digital
          assets (“<strong>Digital Assets</strong>”) across one or more
          third-party blockchains through a series of credible commitments. For
          the avoidance of doubt, your Digital Wallet is not part of the Website
          and is not a Service made available by Common under this Agreement.
          Common has no obligation to monitor or control any use of any Digital
          Wallet by you or any third party on or through the Website and/or any
          use of any Digital Wallet that does not take place on or through the
          Website. Common makes no representations or warranties about the
          functionality of any Digital Wallet. All use of a Digital Wallet is
          undertaken at your own risk, and Common is not and shall not be liable
          to you or to any third party for any loss or damage arising from or
          connected to your or any third party’s use of a Digital Wallet.
          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the terms

            described below. There are important risks and limitations

              <strong>The Services.</strong> Common’s Services include a
              proprietary online platform enabled through the Website, and
              supported documentation made available therewith, that allows
              Users to create or join online communities of Users that meet
              certain criteria (“<strong>Communities</strong>”), create and post
              written or image-based content for discussion, connect to and
              transact through compatible third-party digital wallets (each, a “
              <strong>Digital Wallet</strong>”), and acquire or dispose of
              memecoins and other fungible Digital Assets (“
              <strong>Tokens</strong>”). Users may be able to use the Services
              to visualize any Tokens or other Digital Assets (collectively, “
              <strong>User Assets</strong>”) that are associated with a Digital
              Wallet and write transactions to be executed by such Digital
              Wallet on third-party distributed ledgers compatible with the
              Services (each, a “<strong>Supported Blockchain</strong>”) in
              accordance with the technological and contractual parameters of
              such Supported Blockchain (the applicable “
              <strong>Blockchain Rules</strong>”). User Asset visualizations may
              include graphs, projections, and other information about your User
              Assets (collectively, “<strong>User Asset Information</strong>”).
              Certain Users (each, a “<strong>Project</strong>”) can also use
              certain Software and Services to mint and offer for sale unique
              collections of Tokens, as set forth herein, and use Software and
              other Services to manage such Tokens (all such Software and
              Services collectively, the “<strong>Launchpad</strong>”).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Disclaimers.</strong> THE SERVICES ARE AN ADMINISTRATIVE
              PLATFORM ONLY. THE SERVICES ARE NOT, AND COMMON DOES NOT PROVIDE,
              LEGAL OR COMPLIANCE SERVICES. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, AND
              NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU ARE SOLELY
              RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT YOUR USE OF THE LAUNCHPAD, LAUNCH
              AND MANAGEMENT OF ANY TOKENS, OR OTHER USE OF THE SERVICES
              COMPLIES WITH APPLICABLE LAW, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
              COMMON SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO
              SAME. When you use the Launchpad to offer any Tokens, you
              expressly release Common from any liability arising from or
              related to such Tokens or any User activity in connection with
              same, and you agree that you, and not Common, are solely
              responsible for your decision to use the Launchpad, Software, and
              any Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Common Software.</strong> Your use of any software and
              associated documentation that is made available via the Service,
              including without limitation the Launchpad smart contracts (“
              <strong>Software</strong>”) is governed by the terms of the
              license agreement that accompanies or is included with the
              Software, or by the license agreement expressly stated on the
              Website page(s) accompanying the Software. These license terms may
              be posted with the Software downloads or at the Website page where
              the Software can be accessed. Unless you agree to the terms of
              such license agreement, you shall not use, download, or install
              any Software that is accompanied by or includes a license
              agreement. At no time will Common provide you with any tangible
              copy of our Software. Common delivers access to the Software via
              electronic transfer or download and does not use or deliver any
              tangible media in connection with the (i) delivery, installation,
              updating or problem resolution of any Software (including any new
              releases); or (ii) delivery, correction or updating of
              documentation. Unless the accompanying license agreement expressly
              allows otherwise, any copying or redistribution of the Software is
              prohibited, including any copying or redistribution of the
              Software to any other server or location, or redistribution or use
              on a service bureau basis. If there is any conflict between this
              Agreement and the license agreement, the license agreement takes
              precedence in relation to that Software (except as provided in the
              following sentence). If the Software is a pre-release version,
              then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary included within an
              accompanying license agreement, you are not permitted to use or
              otherwise rely on the Software for any commercial or production
              purposes. If you and Common have not entered into a separate
              license agreement with respect to your use of the Software or if
              no license agreement accompanies use of the Software, use of the
              Software will be governed by this Agreement and, subject to your
              compliance with this Agreement, Common grants you a
              non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable,
              non-exclusive license to use the Software for the sole purpose of
              enabling you to use the Service in the manner permitted by this
              Agreement. Some Software may be offered under an OSS License
              (defined below). There may be provisions in the OSS License that
              expressly override this Agreement.

              <strong>Open Source Software.</strong> You acknowledge and agree

              <strong>OSS</strong>” or “<strong>OSS License</strong>”, as
              applicable), and that your use of the Service is subject to, and
              you agree to comply with, any applicable OSS Licenses. Each item
              of OSS is licensed under the terms of the end-user license that
              accompanies such OSS. Nothing in this Agreement limits your rights
              under, or grants you rights that supersede, the terms and

                acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Agreement and the

                the Project that hosts the applicable Community, and not Common,
                is responsible for the policies and operation of such Community,
                including without limitation any membership eligibility
                criteria, and any action or inaction taken by such Project in

                <strong>Moderation.</strong> Moderating a Community, whether as
                a Project or individual User, is an unofficial, voluntary
                position. We do not verify or validate any User’s right to
                access or moderate any Community and we are not responsible for
                any action taken by the moderators. If you choose to moderate a
                Community, you agree (i) to follow the AUP and the terms of this
                Agreement; (ii) to take appropriate action in response to
                reports related to the Community that you moderate, including
                without limitation escalating such reports to us; (iii) that you
                are not, and you shall not represent that you are, authorized to
                act on our behalf; (iv) not to enter into any agreement with any

                non-public information to which you get access in connection
                with moderation only for the purposes of moderation; and (vi)
                any Community Guidelines you create for the Community that you
                moderate will not conflict with this Agreement.

              <strong>Community Stake. “Stake</strong>” means an NFT asset that
              is created by a Project or other User when such User engages with
              certain Software through a Community, and may be subject to
              Supplemental Terms as set forth on the Service. There may be Fees

              the Software underlying such Stake, as further set forth on the
              Service. Your use of or interaction with the Stake relies on
              interactions with the applicable Supported Blockchain. For more

              <strong>Common Aura (Points) Program.</strong> Subject to your
              ongoing compliance with this Agreement and any Common Aura Program
              Terms (defined below) made available by Common from time to time,
              Common may enable you to participate in a limited program that
              rewards users for interacting with the Service (the “Common Aura
              Program”) by allocating such users with Digital Assets that bear
              no cash or monetary value and are made available by Common. These
              Digital Assets are referred to as “Points” (known as “Aura” on the
              platform), as further described below. Your participation in the
              Common Aura Program constitutes your acceptance of the
              then-current terms and conditions applicable to the Common Aura
              Program at the time of such participation (the “Common Aura
              Program Terms”), as may be modified or updated by Common in its
              sole discretion. Additional terms applicable to the Common Aura
              Program, which shall constitute part of the CommonnAura Program
              Terms, may be set forth on the Services from time to time. For

              <strong>Transactions on Supported Blockchains.</strong> By
              combining publicly available information with your interactions
              with the Services, the Services can draft standard transaction
              messages that are designed to accomplish your operational goals as
              expressed through the interactions with the Services. You may
              broadcast such messages to the validator network for any Supported
              Blockchain in order to initiate a transaction of User Assets
              through your Digital Wallet. The User must personally review and
              authorize all transaction messages that the User wishes to
              execute; this requires the User to sign the relevant transaction
              message with the User’s Private Key (defined below). The
              User-authorized message will then be broadcast to validators
              through the Digital Wallet, and the User may pay a Gas Fee to have
              the validators record the results of the transaction message on
              the applicable Supported Blockchain, resulting in a transfer of
              User Assets. Common and the Services are not agents or
              intermediaries of the User, do not store or have access to or
              control over any User Assets, Private Keys, passwords, Accounts or
              other property of the User, and are not capable of performing
              transactions or sending transaction messages on behalf of the
              User. All transactions relating to the Tokens (“
              <strong>Token Transactions</strong>”) are effected and recorded
              solely through the interactions of the User with the respective
              Projects, who are not under the control of or affiliated with
              Common or the Services. Common does not process or transmit any
              such Token Transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compatibility Risk.</strong> The Services may not be
              compatible with all forms of cryptocurrency, blockchains, and/or
              types of transactions, and certain of your User Assets may not be
              compatible with the Services. Whether or not a User Asset is
              then-currently compatible with the Services may change at any
              time, in Common’s sole discretion, with or without notice to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Taxes</strong>. You are solely responsible (and Common has
              no responsibility) for determining what, if any, taxes apply to
              any transactions involving your User Assets.

              <strong>AI Tools.</strong> Our Services leverage certain
              third-party generative AI tools (“AI Tools”) to collect, analyze,
              and respond to user prompts and requests in connection with the
              matching service and to provide automated advice with respect to
              dating and social interactions. By using any AI Tools, you hereby
              consent and authorize Common to share any Content (defined below)
              or other information you provide to the AI Tools with the
              applicable Third-Party Service in order to complete your request.
              YOU, AND NOT COMMON, SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR USE OF
              THE AI TOOLS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY CONDUCT YOU
              ENGAGE IN AS A RESULT OF THE OUTPUT PROVIDED BY THE AI TOOLS IS AT
              YOUR OWN RISK. BECAUSE AI TOOLS UTILIZE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO
              COMMUNICATE WITH YOU, THE AI TOOLS MAY PROVIDE OUTPUT THAT IS
              INACCURATE, INAPPROPRIATE, OR DOES NOT COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAW.
              YOU AGREE THAT COMMON WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY
              FOR ANY OUTPUT PROVIDED BY AI TOOLS OR YOUR OR ANY THIRD PARTY’S
              USE OF OR RELIANCE ON SAME.

              whom you interact, including without limitation any Project;
              provided, however, that Common reserves the right, but has no
              obligation, to intercede in such disputes. You agree that Common
              will not be responsible for any liability incurred as the result
              of such interactions.

              <strong>Registering Your Account.</strong> To access certain

              account on the Services (“<strong>Account</strong>”).
              Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you acknowledge
              and agree that you have no ownership or other property interest in
              your Account, and you further acknowledge and agree that all
              rights in and to your Account are and will forever be owned by and
              inure to the benefit of Common. Furthermore, you are responsible
              for all activities that occur under your Account. You shall
              monitor your Account to restrict use by minors, and you will
              accept full responsibility for any unauthorized use of the
              Services by minors. You may not share your Account or password
              with anyone, and you agree to notify Common immediately of any
              unauthorized use of your password or any other breach of security.
              You shall not have more than one Account at any given time. Common
              reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time
              and for any reason, including but not limited to, claims by a
              third party that a username violates the third party’s rights. You
              agree not to create an Account or use the Services if you have
              been previously removed by Common, or if you have been previously
              banned from any of the Services.

              <strong>Registration Data.</strong> When you access or use the

              current and complete information about yourself as may be prompted
              by the Services from time to time (the “
              <strong>Registration Data</strong>”); and (b) maintain and
              promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate,
              current and complete. You acknowledge and agree that our
              obligation to provide you with any Services is conditioned on the
              Registration Data being accurate and complete at all times during
              the term of this Agreement. If you provide any information that is
              untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Common has
              reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provide is
              untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Common has the
              right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services and
              refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any
              portion thereof). You agree not to use the Services if you have
              been previously removed by Common, or if you have been previously
              banned from any of the Services. Common reserves the right to
              obtain and retain any Registration Data or other identifying
              information as it may determine from time to time in order for you
              to use and continue to use the Services.

              <strong>Digital Wallets.</strong> In connection with certain
              features of the Services you may need to send cryptocurrency
              assets to or from a Digital Wallet. If you do not have a Digital
              Wallet, the Services may allow you to create one using Magic Labs,
              Inc. (“<strong>Magic</strong>”). Creating a Digital Wallet through
              Magic is subject to additional terms and conditions between you
              and Magic. You represent that you are entitled to use such a
              Digital Wallet. Please note that if a Digital Wallet or associated
              service becomes unavailable then you should not attempt to use
              such Digital Wallet in connection with the Services, and we
              disclaim all liability in connection with the foregoing, including
              without limitation any inability to access any User Assets you
              have sent to such Digital Wallet. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR
              RELATIONSHIP WITH MAGIC OR ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS
              ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR DIGITAL WALLET IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR
              AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND COMMON
              DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT
              OR USER ASSETS THAT MAY BE DEPLOYED TO ANY SUPPORTED BLOCKCHAIN BY
              OR THROUGH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE
              SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH DIGITAL WALLETS. Access to your
              Digital Wallet may require the use of a private key or passphrase
              (“<strong>Private Key</strong>”) and Common has no ability to
              access your Digital Wallet without your involvement and authority.
              Your Private Key is unique to you, and shall be maintained by you.
              If you lose your Private Key, you may lose access to your Digital
              Wallet and any contents thereof. Common does not have the ability
              to recover a lost Private Key. While a Digital Wallet may be
              interoperable with other compatible blockchain platforms, tokens,
              or services, only User Assets supported by Common that are stored
              in your Digital Wallet will be accessible through the Services.
              When you use the Services in connection with any User Assets, you
              represent and warrant that (a) you own or have the authority to
              connect to the applicable Digital Wallet; (b) you own or have the
              authority to deploy such User Assets; (c) all User Assets you
              deploy, transfer, deposit, or otherwise make available in
              connection with our Services have been earned, received, or
              otherwise acquired by you in compliance with all applicable laws;
              and (d) no User Assets that you deploy, transfer, deposit, or
              otherwise make available in connection with the Services have been
              “tumbled” or otherwise undergone any process designed to hide,
              mask, or obscure the origin or ownership of such User Assets.

              <strong>Access Through a Linked App.</strong> The Service may
              allow you to link your Account with a third-party Digital Wallet
              or valid account on a third-party platform or social network
              (each, a “<strong>Linked Account</strong>”) by allowing Common to
              access your Linked Account, as is permitted under the applicable
              terms and conditions that govern your use of each Linked Account.
              You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Linked
              Account login information to Common and/or grant Common access to
              your Linked Account (including, but not limited to, for use for
              the purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the
              terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Linked
              Account and without obligating Common to pay any fees or making
              Common subject to any usage limitations imposed by such
              Third-Party Service providers. By granting Common access to any
              Linked Account, you understand that Common may access, make
              available and store (if applicable) any information, data, text,
              software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages,
              tags and/or other materials (“<strong>Content</strong>”) that you
              have provided to and stored in your Linked Account (“
              <strong>Linked App Content</strong>”) so that it is available on
              and through the Service via your Account. Unless otherwise
              specified in this Agreement, all Linked App Content is considered
              to be Your Content (defined below) for all purposes of this
              Agreement. Depending on the Linked Accounts you choose and subject
              to the privacy settings that you have set in such Linked Accounts,
              personally identifiable information that you post to your Linked
              Accounts may be available on and through your Account on the
              Service. If a Linked Account or associated service becomes
              unavailable, or Common’s access to such Linked Account is
              terminated by the Third-Party Service provider, then Linked App
              Content will no longer be available on and through the Service.
              YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS
              ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY
              YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND
              COMMON DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
              INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE
              PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET
              IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS. Common makes no effort to review any
              Linked App Content for any purpose, including but not limited to,
              for accuracy, legality or noninfringement, and Common is not
              responsible for any Linked App Content.

              FINANCIAL OR INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND THAT THE SERVICES ENTAIL A
              RISK OF LOSS AND MAY NOT MEET YOUR NEEDS. The Services provided by
              Common rely on Supported Blockchains and the applicable Blockchain
              Rules, which may not be reliable, consistent or dependent in all
              scenarios. Common may not be able to foresee or anticipate
              technical or other difficulties which may result in data loss or
              other service interruptions. Common encourages you to periodically
              confirm the valuation of your User Assets and the accuracy of any
              User Asset Information through independent sources. Common does
              not and cannot make any guarantee that your User Assets will not
              lose value. The prices of cryptocurrency assets, including Tokens,
              can be extremely volatile. Common makes no warranties as to the
              markets in which your User Assets are staked, transferred,
              purchased, or traded.

              <strong>Expertise and Experience.</strong> You represent and
              warrant that you (i) have the necessary technical expertise and
              ability to review and evaluate the security, integrity and

              <strong>General Risks of Blockchain Technology.</strong> In order
              to be successfully completed, any transaction involving User
              Assets initiated by or sent to your Digital Wallet must be
              confirmed by and recorded on the applicable Supported Blockchain.
              Common has no control over any Supported Blockchain, and therefore
              cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details that you
              submit or receive via our Services will be validated by or
              confirmed on the relevant Supported Blockchain, and Common does
              not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or
              modification requests. You accept and acknowledge that you take
              full responsibility for all activities that you effect through
              your Digital Wallet and accept all risks of loss, including loss
              as a result of any authorized or unauthorized access to your
              Digital Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law. You
              further accept and acknowledge that:
            </li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                There are risks associated with using Digital Assets, including
                but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet
                connections; the risk of malicious software introduction; the
                risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to
                information stored within your Digital Wallet; the risks of
                counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are
                vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with
                bugs, and assets that may become untransferable; and the risk
                that such Digital Assets may fluctuate in value. You accept and
                acknowledge that Common will not be responsible for any
                communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, delays
                or losses you may experience when using blockchain technology,
                however caused.

              <li>
                The regulatory regimes governing blockchain technologies,
                cryptocurrencies, and tokens are uncertain, and new regulations
                or policies, or new or different interpretations of existing
                regulations, may materially adversely affect the development of
                the Services and the value of your User Assets.

                Common makes no guarantee as to the functionality of any
                blockchain’s decentralized governance, which could, among other
                things, lead to delays, conflicts of interest, or operational
                decisions (including without limitation changes to any
                Blockchain Rules) that are unfavorable to your User Assets. You
                acknowledge and accept that the Blockchain Rules governing the
                operation of a Supported Blockchain may be subject to sudden
                changes which may materially alter such Supported Blockchain and
                affect the value and function of any of your User Assets staked
                on or to that Supported Blockchain.
              </li>
              <li>
                Common makes no guarantee as to the security of any Supported
                Blockchain or Digital Wallet. Common is not liable for any
                hacks, double spending, or any other attacks on a Supported
                Blockchain or Digital Wallet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any Supported Blockchain may slash or otherwise impose penalties
                on certain validators (including validators to which your User
                Assets have been deployed) in response to any activity not
                condoned by such Supported Blockchain, whether in accordance
                with the applicable Blockchain Rules or otherwise. You
                acknowledge and agree that Common shall have no liability in
                connection with any such slashing or penalties, including any
                slashing or penalties that result in a loss or depreciation of
                value of your User Assets.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Supported Blockchains are controlled by third parties, and
                Common is not responsible for their performance nor any risks
                associated with the use thereof. The Services rely on, and
                Common makes no guarantee or warranties as to the functionality
                of or access to, any Supported Blockchain, Digital Wallet, or

              Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.
            </strong>{' '}
            It is Common’s policy to terminate membership privileges of any user
            who repeatedly infringes copyright, trademark, or other intellectual
            property rights upon prompt notification to Common by the respective
            intellectual property owner or their legal agent. Without limiting
            the foregoing, if you believe that your work has been copied and
            posted on the Service in a way that constitutes intellectual
            property rights infringement, please provide our designated
            intellectual property agent with the following information: (i) an
            electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on
            behalf of the owner of the copyright, trademark, or other
            intellectual property right; (ii) a description of the copyrighted
            work, trademark, or other intellectual property right that you claim
            has been infringed; (iii) a description of the location on the
            Service of the material that you claim is infringing; (iv) your
            address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a written
            statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed
            use is not authorized by the copyright, trademark, or other
            intellectual property right owner, its agent or the law; and (vi) a
            statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above
            information in your notice is accurate and that you are the
            copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right owner or
            authorized to act on the copyright, trademark, or other intellectual
            property right owner’s behalf. Contact information for Common’s
            designated agent for notice of claims of infringement is as follows:

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Fees.</strong> Access to the Website and certain Services
              is free. However, Common reserves the right to charge fees (“
              <strong>Fees</strong>”) in connection with your use of certain
              Services from time to time. All pricing and payment terms for such
              Fees are as indicated on the Service, and any payment obligations
              you incur are binding at the time of the applicable transaction.
              In the event that Common makes available, and you elect to
              purchase, any Services in connection with which Common charges
              Fees, you agree that you will pay Common all such Fees at Common’s
              then-current standard rates. You agree that all Fees are
              non-cancellable, non-refundable, and non-recoupable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gas Fees.</strong> You are solely responsible for ensuring
              that any payment made by you is sufficient to cover any Gas Fee
              required to complete any transaction in connection with or effect
              any other use of the Services. “<strong>Gas Fees</strong>” are
              transaction fees determined by market conditions on the applicable
              Supported Blockchain, and are not determined, set, or charged by
              Common.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Taxes.</strong> You are responsible for all federal,
              state, local, sales, use, value added, excise, or other taxes,
              fees, or duties arising out of the Agreement or the transactions
              contemplated by the Agreement (other than taxes based on Common’s

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Promotions.</strong> Common may from time to time make

              prices, or discounted fees (each, a “<strong>Promotion</strong>”)
              to new or existing users of the Services. The rules governing such
              Promotion will be made available in connection with such
              Promotion. Common will determine your eligibility for any
              Promotion in its sole discretion and may change the terms of or
              terminate a Promotion at any time, with or without notice to you.

            <li>
              <strong>Currency.</strong> You may not substitute any other
              currency, whether cryptocurrency or fiat currency, for the
              currency in which you have contracted to pay any Fees. For
              clarity, no fluctuation in the value of any currency, whether
              cryptocurrency or otherwise, shall impact or excuse your
              obligations with respect to any purchase.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment Processing Services.</strong> Common may add or

              due in connection with any Token Transaction, including any Gas
              Fees (“<strong>Token Fees</strong>”). Token Fees are payable to
              the Project or other seller of the applicable Token, and not to
              Common. Common is not a party to any Token Transaction, and you
              agree that Common shall have no liability to any User or any third
              party in connection with any Token Transaction, including without
              limitation any failure of any party to initiate or complete a
              Token Transaction.

            licensors (each, a “<strong>Common Party</strong>” and collectively,

            otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will
            fully cooperate with Common in asserting any available defenses.
            This provision does not require you to indemnify any of the Common
            Parties for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or
            for such party’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation
            or concealment, or suppression or omission of any material fact in

              <strong>Termination of Services by You.</strong> If you want to

              Your Content. All provisions of the Agreement which by their
              nature should survive, shall survive termination of Services,
              including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty
              disclaimers, indemnification and limitation of liability.

              violation of any portion of the Agreement, then you agree that you
              shall not attempt to re-register with or access the Services, and
              you acknowledge that you will not be entitled to receive a refund
              for any Fees related to those Services to which your access has

            countries around the world and may contain references to Services
            and Content that are not available in your country. These references
            do not imply that Common intends to announce such Services or
            Content in your country. Services are controlled and offered by
            Common from its facilities in the United States. Common makes no
            representations that Services are appropriate or available for use
            in other locations. Those who access or use Services from other
            countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for

              <strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> Subject
              to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement (including Section
              16.2, which shall apply notwithstanding any laws or rules in your
              jurisdiction that may prohibit mandatory or compelled
              arbitration), you and Common agree that any dispute, claim,
              disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access
              to or use of the Services or the Terms of Use and prior versions
              of the Terms of Use, including claims and disputes that arose
              between us before the effective date of these Terms of Use (each,
              a “<strong>Dispute</strong>”) will be resolved by binding
              arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (1) you and Common
              may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such
              claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (2) you or
              Common may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or
              other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks,
              trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and
              patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute”
              will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring
              before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Terms of
              Use as well as claims that may arise after the termination of
              these Terms of Use.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> There might be
              instances when a Dispute arises between you and Common. If that
              occurs, Common is committed to working with you to reach a
              reasonable resolution. You and Common agree that good faith
              informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt,
              low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Common therefore
              agree that before either party commences arbitration against the
              other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so
              elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via
              videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any
              Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“
              <strong>Informal Dispute Resolution Conference</strong>”). If you
              are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the
              conference, but you will also participate in the conference. The
              party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in
              writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution
              Conference (“<strong>Notice</strong>”), which shall occur within
              45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an
              extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Common
              that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution
              Conference should be sent by email to the contact information set
              forth below. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone
              number, mailing address, and e‐mail address; (2) the name,
              telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your
              counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute. The
              Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized
              such that a separate conference must be held each time either
              party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of
              law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all
              parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot
              participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference
              unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving
              the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing
              in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from
              engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating
              party’s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution
              Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be
              fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of
              limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the
              parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference
              process required by this section.

              ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A
              TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Common are instead
              electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under
              this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the subsection
              entitled “Applicability of Arbitration Agreement” above. There is
              no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
              arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

              CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY
              INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE
              CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE
              OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration
              Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive
              relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and
              only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
              party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended
              to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Subsection
              16.9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration
              Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not
              subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of
              this Subsection 16.4 are invalid or unenforceable as to a
              particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for
              public injunctive relief), you and Common agree that that
              particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular
              claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration
              and may be litigated in the courts of New York, sitting in New
              York City. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in
              small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or Common
              from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rules and Forum.</strong> The Terms of Use evidence a
              transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any
              other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive
              law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will
              govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration
              Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute
              Resolution Conference process described above does not resolve
              satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your
              Notice, you and Common agree that either party shall have the
              right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration.
              The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
              Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), in accordance with the
              Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) then
              in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration
              Agreement. The AAA Rules are currently available at
              https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf. A
              party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other
              party with a request for arbitration (the “
              <strong>Request</strong>”). The Request must include: (1) the
              name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the
              party seeking arbitration (if applicable) as well as the
              applicable Digital Wallet address; (2) a statement of the legal
              claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a
              description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith
              calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars;
              (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute
              Resolution Conference process as described above; and (5) evidence
              that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in
              connection with such arbitration. If the party requesting
              arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also
              include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and
              email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing
              the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge,
              information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under
              the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented
              for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary
              delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2)
              the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by
              existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending,
              modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;
              and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary
              support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have
              evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further
              investigation or discovery. Unless you and Common otherwise agree,
              or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in subsection 16.9 is
              triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where
              you reside. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a
              limited and reasonable exchange of information between the
              parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
              If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select
              an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any AAA
              fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA
              Rules. You and Common agree that all materials and documents
              exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept
              confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the
              parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then
              subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and
              documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings
              confidential.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Arbitrator.</strong> The arbitrator will be either a
              retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in New York
              and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of
              consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree
              upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the
              Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance
              with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process
              under subsection 16.9 is triggered, the AAA will appoint the
              arbitrator for each batch.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> The arbitrator shall
              have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including,
              without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the
              interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement,
              including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of
              the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration
              Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out
              of or relating to Subsection 16.4, including any claim that all or
              part of Subsection 16.4 is unenforceable, illegal, void or
              voidable, or that Subsection 16.4 has been breached, shall be
              decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
              arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Subsection
              16.9, all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be
              decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
              arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has
              satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided
              only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
              arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the
              Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of
              competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration
              proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or
              joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly
              provided in Subsection 16.9. The arbitrator shall have the
              authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
              Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement
              of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on
              which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages
              awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you
              and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any
              court having jurisdiction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.</strong> The parties shall bear
              their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the
              arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the
              relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an
              improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
              Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or Common need to
              invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to
              compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order
              compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to
              collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary
              disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing
              an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court
              action relating to whether either party has satisfied any
              condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute
              Resolution Conference process, is entitled to recover their
              reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable
              attorneys’ fees and costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Batch Arbitration.</strong> To increase the efficiency of
              administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Common
              agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more
              individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed
              against Common by or with the assistance of the same law firm,
              group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day
              period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1)
              administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per
              batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left
              over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting
              of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each
              batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a
              single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and
              administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural
              calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the
              arbitrator, and one final award (“
              <strong>Batch Arbitration</strong>”). All parties agree that
              Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out
              of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the
              same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.
              To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch
              Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA,
              and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine
              the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“
              <strong>Administrative Arbitrator</strong>”). In an effort to
              expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative
              Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may
              set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes
              promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by
              Common. You and Common agree to cooperate in good faith with the
              AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the
              payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of
              Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of
              arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery
              special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of
              discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar
              of the arbitration proceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision
              shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective
              and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration
              involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances,
              except as expressly set forth in this provision.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</strong> You have the right to
              opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending
              written notice of your decision to opt out to the address set
              forth below, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject
              to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name
              and address, email address, Digital Wallet address (if you have
              one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of
              this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration
              Agreement, all other parts of these Terms of Use will continue to
              apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no
              effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently
              have, or may enter in the future, with us.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Invalidity, Expiration.</strong> Except as provided in
              Subsection 16.4, if any part or parts of this Arbitration
              Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable,
              then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect
              and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration
              Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You further
              agree that any Dispute that you have with Common as detailed in
              this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration
              within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or
              controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you
              agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to
              such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of
              limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent
              jurisdiction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Modification.</strong> Notwithstanding any provision in
              these Terms of Use to the contrary, we agree that if Common makes
              any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will
              notify you. Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days
              of such change become effective by writing to Common at the
              address set forth in Section 17.10, your continued use of the
              Services, including the acceptance of products and services
              offered on the Services following the posting of changes to this
              Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such
              changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you
              with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if
              you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms of Use and
              did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change
              or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an
              existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or
              relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any
              communications you receive, or these Terms of Use, the provisions
              of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted
              the Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these
              Terms of Use) remain in full force and effect. Common will
              continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement
              that you made to a prior version of these Terms of Use.

              <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration
              proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the
              arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly
              confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless
              otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a
              party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary
              to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to
              seek injunctive or equitable relief.

              <strong>Independent Contractors.</strong> The relationship of

              contractors. Notwithstanding anything else set forth herein,
              neither party will be deemed to be an employee, agent, partner or
              legal representative of the other for any purpose and neither will
              have any right, power or authority to create any obligation or
              responsibility on behalf of the other. Your use of the Services
