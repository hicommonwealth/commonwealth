# Chains-events Microservice

## Design

![](Chain_Events_Service.drawio.png)

## Explanation

### ChainEventsSubscriber

- This server subscribes to a subset of chains in order to capture chain-events which it subsequently
  formats and enriches. Once the chain-event is properly formatted, it is published to the ChainEvents Exchange
  using the RabbitMQHandler.

### ChainEventsConsumer

- This server initializes an instance of the ServiceConsumer. The ServiceConsumer is passed
  a single processor function for each queue that it will subscribe to. For an example see:
  [ChainEventsQueueProcessor](ChainEventsConsumer/MessageProcessors/ChainEventsQueue.ts).
- The processor functions are passed as RabbitMQSubscription see: [RabbitMQSubscription](../../common-common/src/ServiceConsumer.ts)
- The ChainEventsConsumer publishes ChainEvent, ChainEventType, and ChainEntity CUD messages to the CUD Exchange

### Queues

For more information on RabbitMQ and the queues see the [README.md](../../common-common/src/rabbitmq/README.md)

- ChainEventsQueue
  - Receives formatted and enriched chain-events to be processed by the ChainEventsConsumer
- ChainCDChainEventsQueue
  - New chains and chainNodes created on the master service that the ChainEventsConsumer saves in the ChainEvents service
    database.
