[2026-01-06] Initial Setup: GitHub-First AI Workflow with Automatic Branching
- Migrated from prd.json to GitHub Issues as single source of truth
- Created .ai/run.sh with automatic branch creation and management
- Implemented branch naming convention: <author>/<type>-<issue-number>-<title-slug>
- Author determination: AI_AUTHOR_INITIALS env var > git config user.initials > derived from git user.name
- Created .ai/setup-labels.sh for label setup (includes type:* labels)
- Created .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ai-task.md template with type labels
- Created .ai/create-ticket.sh - AI-powered ticket generator from descriptions
- Created .ai/quickstart.md - Quick start guide for new developers
- Updated readme with comprehensive workflow guide and branching strategy
- Branch creation logic: detects author, type from labels, generates slug from title
- Handles edge cases: existing branches, non-master starting point, manual branches
- Ticket generator: analyzes description, infers metadata, generates compliant issues
- Example branches: ro/feature-1234-add-user-auth, ro/fix-5678-button-alignment
- Commit: (to be added by next commit)
