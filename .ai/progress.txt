[2026-01-06] Initial Setup: GitHub-First AI Workflow with Automatic Branching
- Migrated from prd.json to GitHub Issues as single source of truth
- Created .ai/run.sh with automatic branch creation and management
- Implemented branch naming convention: <author>/<type>-<issue-number>-<title-slug>
- Author determination: AI_AUTHOR_INITIALS env var > git config user.initials > derived from git user.name
- Created .ai/setup-labels.sh for label setup (includes type:* labels)
- Created .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ai-task.md template with type labels
- Created .ai/create-ticket.sh - AI-powered ticket generator from descriptions
- Created .ai/quickstart.md - Quick start guide for new developers
- Updated readme with comprehensive workflow guide and branching strategy
- Branch creation logic: detects author, type from labels, generates slug from title
- Handles edge cases: existing branches, non-master starting point, manual branches
- Ticket generator: analyzes description, infers metadata, generates compliant issues
- Example branches: ro/feature-1234-add-user-auth, ro/fix-5678-button-alignment
- Commit: (to be added by next commit)

[2026-01-07] Feature Flag: FLAG_MARKETS for Prediction Markets Visibility Control
- Completed GitHub issue #13265
- Added FLAG_MARKETS feature flag to control visibility of prediction markets functionality across the application
- Key implementation decisions:
  * FLAG_MARKETS already defined in feature-flags.ts using buildFlag helper (line 52)
  * FLAG_MARKETS already exposed in vite.config.ts (line 73)
  * Routes already conditionally rendered in navigation files using spread operator pattern
  * Updated governance_section.tsx to use marketsEnabled flag for Markets menu item visibility
  * Updated AdminSection.tsx to use marketsEnabled flag for Market Integrations menu visibility
  * Added FLAG_MARKETS to .env.example with default value of false for safe rollout
- Files changed:
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/components/sidebar/governance_section.tsx - Added useFlag('markets') and set isVisible: marketsEnabled for Markets menu
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/components/sidebar/AdminSection/AdminSection.tsx - Added useFlag('markets') import and set isVisible: marketsEnabled for Market Integrations menu
  * .env.example - Added FLAG_MARKETS documentation in Feature Flags section
- Tests:
  * Type checking shows pre-existing Soneium-related errors (not introduced by this change)
  * Linting shows pre-existing warnings in market integration files (not introduced by this change)
  * Unit tests require database connection (not available in current environment)
  * Manual verification required: test with FLAG_MARKETS=true and FLAG_MARKETS=false
- Concerns for reviewers:
  * Verify Markets menu in Apps section hides when FLAG_MARKETS=false
  * Verify Market Integrations in Admin Capabilities section hides when FLAG_MARKETS=false
  * Test direct URL access to /markets-app and /:scope/manage/markets when flag is disabled
  * Confirm routes properly return 404 or redirect when flag is off
- Commit: 14779d72899558242378b4e6006a004d7e9ed438
- Follow-up fix for React Hooks error:
  * Converted Router from a function to a React component
  * Router now returns <RouterProvider> directly instead of router config object
  * Moved useFlag('markets') call to Router component where hooks are properly called
  * Updated App.tsx to use <Router /> as component instead of router()
  * Passed marketsEnabled as parameter to CommonDomainRoutes/CustomDomainRoutes
  * Fixed "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error
  * Commit: f3910b09be
- Backend API validation:
  * Added FLAG_MARKETS to backend config (libs/model/src/config.ts)
  * Added validation to GetMarkets query - throws InvalidState when flag disabled
  * Added validation to SubscribeMarket command - throws InvalidState when flag disabled
  * Added validation to UnsubscribeMarket command - throws InvalidState when flag disabled
  * Ensures markets API cannot be accessed by bypassing frontend controls
  * Commit: c3b3dfafe8
  * Fix: Added MARKETS to Zod schema validation to resolve undefined config error
  * Commit: 3e54e37d98

[2026-01-08] Refactor: Refactored betting markets admin components to align with community market design patterns
- Completed GitHub issue #13274
- Key implementation decisions:
  * Aligned admin components with MarketsAppPage styling and component patterns (light theme)
  * Used CW component kit components (CWText, CWButton, CWTag, CWTextInput, CWSelectList, CWCircleMultiplySpinner)
  * Applied light theme styling matching MarketsAppPage: white backgrounds (#ffffff), dark text (#1a1a1a, #212529), light borders (#e9ecef)
  * Maintained consistent card styling with hover effects, rounded corners, and gradient provider badges
  * Implemented proper empty state handling with descriptive messages
  * Used responsive grid layout (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
  * Applied proper status tag color coding (active, new, info)
  * Added proper date formatting matching MarketsAppPage patterns
  * Replaced inline styles and native HTML elements with CW component kit
- Files changed:
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/components/MarketIntegrations/MarketSelector.tsx (refactored to use CW components and proper layout)
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/components/MarketIntegrations/MarketSelector.scss (created new styles matching MarketsAppPage light theme)
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/components/MarketIntegrations/MarketFilters.tsx (refactored to use CWTextInput and CWSelectList with react-select API)
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/components/MarketIntegrations/MarketFilters.scss (created responsive filter layout)
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/components/MarketIntegrations/MarketCard.tsx (refactored to match MarketsAppPage card design with tags, badges, and CWButton)
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/components/MarketIntegrations/MarketCard.scss (completely rewritten to match MarketsAppPage light theme styling)
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/components/MarketIntegrations/MarketList.tsx (added proper empty state with CWText)
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/components/MarketIntegrations/MarketList.scss (updated grid layout and added empty state styles with light theme)
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/pages/CommunityManagement/Markets/MarketsPage.scss (simplified to match overall structure)
- Tests: All unit tests pass (70 tests in commonwealth package)
- Type checking: No type errors in modified files (pre-existing unrelated errors in model package about Soneium property)
- Linting: All checks pass
- Concerns for reviewers:
  * Verify visual consistency between admin and community market views
  * Test responsive behavior on mobile devices
  * Confirm light theme colors match design system and are consistent
  * Validate that status tag colors align with UX expectations
  * Check that CWSelectList dropdowns work correctly with react-select API

[2026-01-09] Refactor: Market discovery APIs to state/api/markets pattern
- Completed GitHub issue #13288
- Key implementation decisions:
  * Moved market discovery functions from client/scripts/services/ to client/scripts/state/api/markets/
  * Created React Query hooks (useDiscoverKalshiMarketsQuery, useDiscoverPolymarketMarketsQuery) following existing patterns from communities/, snapshots/, communityStake/
  * Added Kalshi and Polymarket API endpoints to ExternalEndpoints in config.ts
  * Added proper TypeScript interfaces for API responses (KalshiEvent, PolymarketMarketResponse)
  * Improved Polymarket error handling with array validation and proper error logging
  * Added limit parameter (200) to Polymarket API to match Kalshi behavior
  * Each hook exports both the raw fetch function (discoverKalshiMarkets, discoverPolymarketMarkets) and the hook (useDiscoverKalshiMarketsQuery, useDiscoverPolymarketMarketsQuery)
  * Set 5-minute stale time for both APIs to balance freshness with performance
  * Removed the now-empty client/scripts/services/ directory
- Files changed:
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/state/api/config.ts - Added kalshi and polymarket to ExternalEndpoints
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/state/api/markets/discoverKalshiMarkets.ts - New file with typed Kalshi API hook
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/state/api/markets/discoverPolymarketMarkets.ts - New file with typed Polymarket API hook
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/state/api/markets/index.ts - Barrel export for markets module
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/views/components/MarketIntegrations/useMarketData.ts - Updated imports to use new hooks
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/services/kalshiApi.ts - Deleted
  * packages/commonwealth/client/scripts/services/polymarketApi.ts - Deleted
- Tests: No unit tests added (external API integrations, manual verification required)
- Type checking: No market-related type errors (pre-existing Soneium errors unrelated to changes)
- Linting: All checks pass
- Concerns for reviewers:
  * Verify Kalshi markets load correctly in the Markets page UI
  * Verify Polymarket markets load correctly (improved error handling should help debug issues)
  * Test search filtering across both providers
  * Check browser console for any API errors or CORS issues
- Commit: 5a6a55cef6
- Follow-up fix for Polymarket CORS issue:
  * Polymarket API (gamma-api.polymarket.com) does not include CORS headers, blocking browser requests
  * Kalshi API works fine in browser (has Access-Control-Allow-Origin header)
  * Solution: Created backend proxy endpoint for Polymarket API calls
  * Added DiscoverExternalMarkets schema and ExternalMarket type to @hicommonwealth/schemas
  * Created DiscoverExternalMarkets.query.ts in model package to proxy Polymarket API
  * Added discoverExternalMarkets endpoint to community tRPC router
  * Updated frontend useDiscoverPolymarketMarketsQuery to use tRPC proxy instead of direct fetch
  * Commit: d75672d776
- Unified all market providers through backend proxy:
  * Extended DiscoverExternalMarkets to support all providers (kalshi, polymarket, all)
  * Added filters (search, category) and limit parameter to API
  * Server-side filtering applied after fetching from external APIs
  * Created single useDiscoverExternalMarketsQuery hook replacing separate Kalshi/Polymarket hooks
  * Removed client-side discoverKalshiMarkets.ts and discoverPolymarketMarkets.ts
  * Removed kalshi/polymarket endpoints from client config.ts (now only on backend)
  * Simplified useMarketData.ts - no more client-side filtering needed
  * Commit: b10692a4ae
- Fixed Polymarket API to use /events endpoint (not /markets):
  * /markets returns individual outcomes (e.g., 10 deportation buckets as separate items)
  * /events returns grouped events (single "How many will Trump deport?" event)
  * Added active=true filter to only return active events
  * Both APIs now return unique, open events without duplicates
  * Commit: 052c07c9c9

[2026-01-09] Feature: Automated PR creation script
- Completed GitHub issue #13290
- Created .ai/create-pr.sh script that automates GitHub PR creation from current branch
- Key implementation decisions:
  * Followed existing .ai/ script patterns (colors, gh CLI checks, error handling)
  * Used grep for ticket extraction instead of bash regex for macOS compatibility (bash 3.2)
  * Supports multiple branch naming conventions: author/type-number-desc, type/number-desc, number-desc
  * Uses GitHub CLI (gh) for all GitHub operations (PR creation, issue lookup, assignments)
  * Generates PR body with "Closes #ticket" reference following GitHub conventions
  * Auto-assigns PR and referenced issue to executing user (@me)
  * Includes comprehensive error handling: gh not installed, not authenticated, detached HEAD, existing PR, uncommitted changes
- Files changed:
  * .ai/create-pr.sh (new file - 310 lines)
  * .ai/progress.txt (updated with progress notes)
- Tests: Script tested with --help flag, dry-run mode, and branch extraction verification
- Concerns for reviewers:
  * Script requires gh CLI to be installed and authenticated
  * PR title defaults to issue title if available, otherwise derived from branch name
  * The script is interactive and requires user confirmation before creating PR
- Commit: 979ff661dc

[2026-01-12] #13294 feat: add external links to betting market cards
- Files: types.ts, MarketCard.tsx, MarketCard.scss, MarketsAppPage.tsx, MarketsAppPage.scss, getExternalMarketUrl.spec.ts
- Changes: Added clickable external links to provider pills on both admin MarketCard and MarketsAppPage. Users can navigate to Polymarket/Kalshi pages.
- Decisions: URL format: Polymarket `/event/{slug}`, Kalshi `/markets/{base_ticker}/{title_slug}/{full_ticker}` (extracts base ticker, slugifies title)
- Issues: None

[2026-01-23] #13307 chore: migrate Alchemy endpoints from alchemyapi.io to g.alchemy.com
- Files: libs/model/src/tester/seedDb.ts, libs/model/migrations/20260123111500-migrate-alchemy-endpoints.js
- Changes: Updated test seed database URLs from deprecated alchemyapi.io to new g.alchemy.com domain. Added database migration to update existing ChainNodes with old Alchemy URLs.
- Decisions: Migration handles both HTTPS and WSS URL format changes. ethers 5.7.2 compatible with new endpoints (6.x upgrade out of scope)
- Issues: Review migration carefully - WSS URL transformation is complex (removes .ws. prefix, adds /ws before API key)
