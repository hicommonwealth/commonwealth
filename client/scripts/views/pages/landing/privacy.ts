Last updated: January 14, 2019

This Privacy Statement explains how Commonwealth Labs, Inc. ("Commonwealth") collects, uses, and discloses information about you through its websites, including web applications, mobile applications, and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.

We may change this Privacy Statement from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Statement and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Statement whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US

When you sign up to use the Services or participate in any interactive features of the Services, we may ask you to provide certain information such as your Digital Wallet information, your name, your mailing address, date of birth, and your email. We also collect information about you when you fill out a form, participate in promotional, incentive, or other platform program, make a purchase, apply for a job, communicate with us via third-party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us, or any other information you choose to provide to us. In some instances, we may request that you provide a copy of your passport or government-issued ID. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, "Digital Wallet" means an application or software that a Governance Interface User or potential Governance Interface User uses to secure their private keys and send blockchain transactions. "Governance Interface User" means a person that Commonwealth has approved to discuss, vote, or delegate tokens for any network without intermediation on the Commonwealth Platform. "Commonwealth Platform" means the Commonwealth Labs decentralized governance platform.

Additionally, when you apply for access to Commonwealth Platform and its Services, you may be required to provide certain personal information for purposes of know-your-customer, prevention of potential money laundering activities, or other compliance purposes. In addition, we will verify your ownership of the email address you provided and will ask you to submit a cryptographic signature using your Ethereum, Edgeware, or other network private key, which we will use to verify your ownership of the Network  Address you provide to us. "Network Address" means the unique public key cryptocurrency identifier that points to an Network-compatible wallet to which cryptocurrency may be sent or stored.
